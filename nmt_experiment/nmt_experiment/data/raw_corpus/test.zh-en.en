And you'll need to attract families, the residents who will come and live there permanently, raise their children, get an education for their children, and get their first job.
With that charter, people will move there.
The city can be built.
And we can scale this model.
We can go do it over and over again.
To make it work, we need good rules. We've already discussed that.
Those are captured in the charter.
We also need the choices for people.
That's really built into the model if we allow for the possibility of building cities on uninhabited land.
You start from uninhabited territory.
People can come live under the new charter, but no one is forced to live under it.
The final thing we need are choices for leaders.
And, to achieve the kind of choices we want for leaders we need to allow for the potential for partnerships between nations: cases where nations work together, in effect, de facto, the way China and Britain worked together to build, first a little enclave of the market model, and then scale it throughout China.
In a sense, Britain, inadvertently, through its actions in Hong Kong, did more to reduce world poverty than all the aid programs that we've undertaken in the last century.
So if we allow for these kind of partnerships to replicate this again, we can get those kinds of benefits scaled throughout the world.
In some cases this will involve a delegation of responsibility, a delegation of control from one country to another to take over certain kinds of administrative responsibilities.
Now, when I say that, some of you are starting to think, "Well, is this just bringing back colonialism?"
It's not. But it's important to recognize that the kind of emotions that come up when we start to think about these things, can get in the way, can make us pull back, can shut down our ability, and our interest in trying to explore new ideas.
Why is this not like colonialism?
The thing that was bad about colonialism, and the thing which is residually bad in some of our aid programs, is that it involved elements of coercion and condescension.
This model is all about choices, both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places.
And, choice is the antidote to coercion and condescension.
So let's talk about how this could play out in practice.
Let's take a particular leader, Raul Castro, who is the leader of Cuba.
It must have occurred to Castro that he has the chance to do for Cuba what Deng Xiaoping did for China, but he doesn't have a Hong Kong there on the island in Cuba.
He does, though, have a little bit of light down in the south that has a very special status.
There is a zone there, around Guantanamo Bay, where a treaty gives the United States administrative responsibility for a piece of land that's about twice the size of Manhattan.
Castro goes to the prime minister of Canada and says, "Look, the Yankees have a terrible PR problem.
They want to get out.
Why don't you, Canada, take over?
Build -- run a special administrative zone.
Allow a new city to be built up there.
Allow many people to come in.
Let us have a Hong Kong nearby.
Some of my citizens will move into that city as well.
Others will hold back. But this will be the gateway that will connect the modern economy and the modern world to my country."
Now, where else might this model be tried?
Well, Africa. I've talked with leaders in Africa.
Many of them totally get the notion of a special zone that people can opt into as a rule.
It's a rule for changing rules.
It's a way to create new rules, and let people opt-in without coercion, and the opposition that coercion can force.
They also totally get the idea that in some instances they can make more credible promises to long-term investors -- the kind of investors who will come build the port, build the roads, in a new city -- they can make more credible promises if they do it along with a partner nation.
Perhaps even in some arrangement that's a little bit like an escrow account, where you put land in the escrow account and the partner nation takes responsibility for it.
There is also lots of land in Africa where new cities could be built.
This is a picture I took when I was flying along the coast.
There are immense stretches of land like this -- land where hundreds of millions of people could live.
Now, if we generalize this and think about not just one or two charter cites, but dozens -- cities that will help create places for the many hundreds of millions, perhaps billions of people who will move to cities in the coming century -- is there enough land for them?
Well, throughout the world, if we look at the lights at night, the one thing that's misleading is that, visually, it looks like most of the world is already built out.
So let me show you why that's wrong.
Take this representation of all of the land.
Turn it into a square that stands for all the arable land on Earth.
And let these dots represent the land that's already taken up by the cities that three billion people now live in.
If you move the dots down to the bottom of the rectangle you can see that the cities for the existing three billion urban residents take up only three percent of the arable land on earth.
So if we wanted to build cities for another billion people, they would be dots like this.
We'd go from three percent of the arable land, to four percent.
We'd dramatically reduce the human footprint on Earth by building more cities that people can move to.
And if these are cities governed by good rules, they can be cities where people are safe from crime, safe from disease and bad sanitation, where people have a chance to get a job.
They can get basic utilities like electricity.
Their kids can get an education.
So what will it take to get started building the first charter cities, scaling this so we build many more?
It would help to have a manual.
What university professors could do is write some details that might go into this manual.
You wouldn't want to let us run the cities, go out and design them.
You wouldn't let academics out in the wild.
But, you could set us to work thinking about questions like, suppose it isn't just Canada that does the deal with Raul Castro.
Perhaps Brazil comes in as a participant, and Spain as well. And perhaps Cuba wants to be one of the partners in a four-way joint venture.
How would we write the treaty to do that?
There is less precedent for that, but that could easily be worked out.
How would we finance this?
Turns out Singapore and Hong Kong are cities that made huge gains on the value of the land that they owned when they got started.
You could use the gains on the value of the land to pay for things like the police, the courts, but the school system and the health care system too, which make this a more attractive place to live, makes this a place where people have higher incomes -- which, incidentally, makes the land more valuable.
So the incentives for the people helping to construct this zone and build it, and set up the basic rules, go very much in the right direction.
So there are many other details like this.
How could we have buildings that are low cost and affordable for people who work in a first job, assembling something like an iPhone, but make those buildings energy efficient, and make sure that they are safe, so they don't fall down in an earthquake or a hurricane.
Many technical details to be worked out, but those of us who are already starting to pursue these things can already tell that there is no roadblock, there's no impediment, other than a failure of imagination, that will keep us from delivering on a truly global win-win solution.
Let me conclude with this picture.
The reason we can be so well off, even though there is so many people on earth, is because of the power of ideas.
We can share ideas with other people, and when they discover them, they share with us.
It's not like scarce objects, where sharing means we each get less.
When we share ideas we all get more.
When we think about ideas in that way, we usually think about technologies.
But there is another class of ideas: the rules that govern how we interact with each other; rules like, let's have a tax system that supports a research university that gives away certain kinds of knowledge for free.
Let's have a system where we have ownership of land that is registered in a government office, that people can pledge as collateral.
If we can keep innovating on our space of rules, and particularly innovate in the sense of coming up with rules for changing rules, so we don't get stuck with bad rules, then we can keep moving progress forward and truly make the world a better place, so that people like Nelson and his friends don't have to study any longer under the streetlights. Thank you.

Craig Venter on DNA and the sea
At the break, I was asked by several people about my comments about the aging debate.
And this will be my only comment on it.
And that is, I understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists.
What I'm going to tell you about in my 18 minutes is how we're about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves.
It's only 10 years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free-living organism, that of haemophilus influenzae.
That took a genome project from 13 years down to four months.
We can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours.
So in the last decade, a large number of genomes have been added: most human pathogens, a couple of plants, several insects and several mammals, including the human genome.
Genomics at this stage of the thinking from a little over 10 years ago was, by the end of this year, we might have between three and five genomes sequenced; it's on the order of several hundred.
We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to sequence 130 genomes this year, as a side project from environmental organisms.
So the rate of reading the genetic code has changed.
But as we look, what's out there, we've barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet.
Most people don't realize it, because they're invisible, but microbes make up about a half of the Earth's biomass, whereas all animals only make up about one one-thousandth of all the biomass.
And maybe it's something that people in Oxford don't do very often, but if you ever make it to the sea, and you swallow a mouthful of seawater, keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of 10 million viruses.
Less than 5,000 microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago, and so we decided to do something about it.
And we started the Sorcerer II Expedition, where we were, as with great oceanographic expeditions, trying to sample the ocean every 200 miles.
We started in Bermuda for our test project, then moved up to Halifax, working down the U.S. East Coast, the Caribbean Sea, the Panama Canal, through to the Galapagos, then across the Pacific, and we're in the process now of working our way across the Indian Ocean.
It's very tough duty; we're doing this on a sailing vessel, in part to help excite young people about going into science.
The experiments are incredibly simple.
We just take seawater and we filter it, and we collect different size organisms on different filters, and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville, where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every 24 hours.
And with doing this, we've made some amazing discoveries.
For example, it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes -- there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments.
It turns out, almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors, and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication.
From one site, from one barrel of seawater, we discovered 1.3 million new genes and as many as 50,000 new species.
We've extended this to the air now with a grant from the Sloan Foundation.
We're measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day, particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums.
We filter through some simple apparatuses; we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in New York City.
And we're in the process of sequencing all that at the present time.
Just on the data collection side, just where we are through the Galapagos, we're finding that almost every 200 miles, we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean.
Some of these make logical sense, in terms of different temperature gradients.
So this is a satellite photograph based on temperatures -- red being warm, blue being cold -- and we found there's a tremendous difference between the warm water samples and the cold water samples, in terms of abundant species.
The other thing that surprised us quite a bit is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light, and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence.
And these vary tremendously from region to region.
Maybe not surprisingly, in the deep ocean, where it's mostly blue, the photoreceptors tend to see blue light.
When there's a lot of chlorophyll around, they see a lot of green light.
But they vary even more, possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet in the extremes.
Just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was, we assembled all the data -- including all of ours thus far from the expedition, which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet -- and it totaled around 29 million genes.
And we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are: Are we just discovering new members of known families, or are we discovering new families?
And it turns out we have about 50,000 major gene families, but every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families.
So we're at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes, components and life on this planet.
When we look at the so-called evolutionary tree, we're up on the upper right-hand corner with the animals.
Of those roughly 29 million genes, we only have around 24,000 in our genome.
And if you take all animals together, we probably share less than 30,000 and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families.
I view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution.
And we think in a gene-centric view -- maybe going back to Richard Dawkins' ideas -- than in a genome-centric view, which are different constructs of these gene components.
Synthetic DNA, the ability to synthesize DNA, has changed at sort of the same pace that DNA sequencing has over the last decade or two, and is getting very rapid and very cheap.
Our first thought about synthetic genomics came when we sequenced the second genome back in 1995, and that from mycoplasma genitalium.
And we have really nice T-shirts that say, you know, "I heart my genitalium."
This is actually just a microorganism.
But it has roughly 500 genes.
Haemophilus had 1,800 genes.
And we simply asked the question, if one species needs 800, another 500, is there a smaller set of genes that might comprise a minimal operating system?
So we started doing transposon mutagenesis.
Transposons are just small pieces of DNA that randomly insert in the genetic code.
And if they insert in the middle of the gene, they disrupt its function.
So we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those "non-essential genes."
But it turns out the environment is very critical for this, and you can only define an essential or non-essential gene based on exactly what's in the environment.
We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of 13 related organisms, and we tried to compare all of those, to see what they had in common.
And we got these overlapping circles. And we found only 173 genes common to all 13 organisms.
The pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite; it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around 310 or so.
So we think that we can expand or contract genomes, depending on your point of view here, to maybe 300 to 400 genes from the minimal of 500.
The only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them, and we had to do this in a cassette-based fashion.
We found that synthesizing accurate DNA in large pieces was extremely difficult.
Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison, my colleagues on this, developed an exciting new method that allowed us to synthesize a 5,000-base pair virus in only a two-week period that was 100 percent accurate, in terms of its sequence and its biology.
It was a quite exciting experiment -- when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA, injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden, that DNA started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria.
This was not the first synthetic virus -- a polio virus had been made a year before -- but it was only one ten-thousandth as active and it took three years to do.
This is a cartoon of the structure of phi X 174.
This is a case where the software now builds its own hardware, and that's the notions that we have with biology.
People immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare, and I had recent testimony before a Senate committee, and a special committee the U.S. government has set up to review this area.
And I think it's important to keep reality in mind, versus what happens with people's imaginations.
Basically, any virus that's been sequenced today -- that genome can be made.
And people immediately freak out about things about Ebola or smallpox, but the DNA from this organism is not infective.
So even if somebody made the smallpox genome, that DNA itself would not cause infections.
The real concern that security departments have is designer viruses.
And there's only two countries, the U.S. and the former Soviet Union, that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents.
If that research is truly discontinued, there should be very little activity on the know-how to make designer viruses in the future.
I think single-cell organisms are possible within two years.
And possibly eukaryotic cells, those that we have, are possible within a decade.
So we're now making several dozen different constructs, because we can vary the cassettes and the genes that go into this artificial chromosome.
The key is, how do you put all of the others?
We start with these fragments, and then we have a homologous recombination system that reassembles those into a chromosome.
This is derived from an organism, deinococcus radiodurans, that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed.
It reassembles its genome after this radiation burst in about 12 to 24 hours, after its chromosomes are literally blown apart.
This organism is ubiquitous on the planet, and exists perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there.
This is a glass beaker after about half a million rads of radiation.
The glass started to burn and crack, while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier.
Here's an actual picture of what happens: the top of this shows the genome after 1.7 million rads of radiation.
The chromosome is literally blown apart.
And here's that same DNA automatically reassembled 24 hours later.
It's truly stunning that these organisms can do that, and we probably have thousands, if not tens of thousands, of different species on this planet that are capable of doing that.
After these genomes are synthesized, the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome.
So we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential, not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues.
For example, from the third organism we sequenced, Methanococcus jannaschii -- it lives in boiling water temperatures; its energy source is hydrogen and all its carbon comes from CO2 it captures back from the environment.
So we know lots of different pathways, thousands of different organisms now that live off of CO2, and can capture that back.
So instead of using carbon from oil for synthetic processes, we have the chance of using carbon and capturing it back from the atmosphere, converting that into biopolymers or other products.
We have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide, and we use as a reducing power to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen.
Also, there's numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane.
And DuPont has a major program with Statoil in Norway to capture and convert the methane from the gas fields there into useful products.
Within a short while, I think there's going to be a new field called "Combinatorial Genomics," because with these new synthesis capabilities, these vast gene array repertoires and the homologous recombination, we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day.
And therefore, as with all biology, you get selection through screening, whether you're screening for hydrogen production, or chemical production, or just viability.
To understand the role of these genes is going to be well within reach.
We're trying to modify photosynthesis to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight.
Photosynthesis is modulated by oxygen, and we have an oxygen-insensitive hydrogenase that we think will totally change this process.
We're also combining cellulases, the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars and fermentation in the same cell for producing ethanol.
Pharmaceutical production is already under way in major laboratories using microbes.
The chemistry from compounds in the environment is orders of magnitude more complex than our best chemists can produce.
I think future engineered species could be the source of food, hopefully a source of energy, environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry.
Let me just close with ethical and policy studies.
We delayed the start of our experiments in 1999 until we completed a year-and-a-half bioethical review as to whether we should try and make an artificial species.
Every major religion participated in this.
It was actually a very strange study, because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books, and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life, so it must be OK. The only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this, but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments for the reasons we were doing them.
Right now the Sloan Foundation has just funded a multi-institutional study on this, to work out what the risk and benefits to society are, and the rules that scientific teams such as my own should be using in this area, and we're trying to set good examples as we go forward.
These are complex issues.
Except for the threat of bio-terrorism, they're very simple issues in terms of, can we design things to produce clean energy, perhaps revolutionizing what developing countries can do and provide through various simple processes.
Thank you very much.

Psychologist Philip Zimbardo says happiness and success are rooted in a trait most of us disregard: the way we orient toward the past, present and future. He suggests we calibrate our outlook on time as a first step to improving our lives.

Philip Zimbardo prescribes a healthy take on time
I want to share with you some ideas about the secret power of time, in a very short time.
Video: All right, start the clock please. 30 seconds studio.
Keep it quiet please. Settle down.
It's about time. End sequence. Take one.
15 seconds studio.
10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two ...
Philip Zimbardo: Let's tune into the conversation of the principals in Adam's temptation.
"Come on Adam, don't be so wishy-washy. Take a bite." "I did."
"One bite, Adam. Don't abandon Eve."
"I don't know, guys.
I don't want to get in trouble."
"Okay. One bite. What the hell?"
Life is temptation. It's all about yielding, resisting, yes, no, now, later, impulsive, reflective, present focus and future focus.
Promised virtues fall prey to the passions of the moment.
Of teenage girls who pledged sexual abstinence and virginity until marriage -- thank you George Bush -- the majority, 60 percent, yielded to sexual temptations within one year.
And most of them did so without using birth control.
So much for promises.
Now lets tempt four-year-olds, giving them a treat.
They can have one marshmallow now. But if they wait until the experimenter comes back, they can have two.
Of course it pays, if you like marshmallows, to wait.
What happens is two-thirds of the kids give in to temptation.
They cannot wait. The others, of course, wait.
They resist the temptation. They delay the now for later.
Walter Mischel, my colleague at Stanford, went back 14 years later, to try to discover what was different about those kids.
There were enormous differences between kids who resisted and kids who yielded, in many ways.
The kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the SAT.
That's enormous. That's like a whole set of different IQ points.
They didn't get in as much trouble. They were better students.
They were self-confident and determined. And the key for me today, the key for you, is, they were future-focused rather than present-focused.
So what is time perspective? That's what I'm going to talk about today.
Time perspective is the study of how individuals, all of us, divide the flow of your human experience into time zones or time categories.
And you do it automatically and non-consciously.
They vary between cultures, between nations, between individuals, between social classes, between education levels.
And the problem is that they can become biased, because you learn to over-use some of them and under-use the others.
What determines any decision you make?
You make a decision on which you're going to base an action.
For some people it's only about what is in the immediate situation, what other people are doing and what you're feeling.
And those people, when they make their decisions in that format -- we're going to call them "present-oriented," because their focus is what is now.
For others, the present is irrelevant.
It's always about "What is this situation like that I've experienced in the past?"
So that their decisions are based on past memories.
And we're going to call those people "past-oriented," because they focus on what was.
For others it's not the past, it's not the present, it's only about the future.
Their focus is always about anticipated consequences.
Cost-benefit analysis.
We're going to call them "future-oriented." Their focus is on what will be.
So, time paradox, I want to argue, the paradox of time perspective, is something that influences every decision you make, you're totally unaware of.
Namely, the extent to which you have one of these biased time perspectives.
Well there is actually six of them. There are two ways to be present-oriented.
There is two ways to be past-oriented, two ways to be future.
You can focus on past-positive, or past-negative.
You can be present-hedonistic, namely you focus on the joys of life, or present-fatalist -- it doesn't matter, your life is controlled.
You can be future-oriented, setting goals.
Or you can be transcendental future: namely, life begins after death.
Developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly depending on the demands of the situation, that's what you've got to learn to do.
So, very quickly, what is the optimal time profile?
High on past-positive. Moderately high on future.
And moderate on present-hedonism.
And always low on past-negative and present-fatalism.
So the optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past -- past-positive gives you roots. You connect your family, identity and your self.
What you get from the future is wings to soar to new destinations, new challenges.
What you get from the present hedonism is the energy, the energy to explore yourself, places, people, sensuality.
Any time perspective in excess has more negatives than positives.
What do futures sacrifice for success?
They sacrifice family time. They sacrifice friend time.
They sacrifice fun time. They sacrifice personal indulgence.
They sacrifice hobbies. And they sacrifice sleep. So it affects their health.
And they live for work, achievement and control.
I'm sure that resonates with some of the TEDsters.
And it resonated for me. I grew up as a poor kid in the South Bronx ghetto, a Sicilian family -- everyone lived in the past and present.
I'm here as a future-oriented person who went over the top, who did all these sacrifices because teachers intervened, and made me future oriented.
Told me don't eat that marshmallow, because if you wait you're going to get two of them, until I learned to balance out.
I've added present-hedonism, I've added a focus on the past-positive, so, at 76 years old, I am more energetic than ever, more productive, and I'm happier than I have ever been.
I just want to say that we are applying this to many world problems: changing the drop-out rates of school kids, combating addictions, enhancing teen health, curing vets' PTSD with time metaphors -- getting miracle cures -- promoting sustainability and conservation, reducing physical rehabilitation where there is a 50-percent drop out rate, altering appeals to suicidal terrorists, and modifying family conflicts as time-zone clashes.
So I want to end by saying: many of life's puzzles can be solved by understanding your time perspective and that of others.
And the idea is so simple, so obvious, but I think the consequences are really profound.
Thank you so much.

How many of today's headlines will matter in 100 years? 1000? Kirk Citron's "Long News" project collects stories that not only matter today, but will resonate for decades -- even centuries -- to come. At TED2010, he highlights recent headlines with the potential to shape our future.

Kirk Citron: And now, the real news
We are drowning in news.
Reuters alone puts out three and a half million news stories a year.
That's just one source.
My question is: How many of those stories are actually going to matter in the long run?
That's the idea behind The Long News.
It's a project by The Long Now Foundation, which was founded by TEDsters including Kevin Kelly and Stewart Brand.
And what we're looking for is news stories that might still matter 50 or 100 or 10,000 years from now.
And when you look at the news through that filter, a lot falls by the wayside.
To take the top stories from the A.P. this last year, is this going to matter in a decade?
Or this?
Or this?
Really?
Is this going to matter in 50 or 100 years?
Okay, that was kind of cool.
But the top story of this past year was the economy, and I'm just betting that, sooner or later, this particular recession is going to be old news.
So, what kind of stories might make a difference for the future?
Well, let's take science.
Someday, little robots will go through our bloodstreams fixing things.
That someday is already here if you're a mouse.
Some recent stories: nanobees zap tumors with real bee venom; they're sending genes into the brain; a robot they built that can crawl through the human body.
What about resources? How are we going to feed nine billion people?
We're having trouble feeding six billion today.
As we heard yesterday, there's over a billion people hungry.
Britain will starve without genetically modified crops.
Bill Gates, fortunately, has bet a billion on [agricultural] research.
What about global politics?
The world's going to be very different when and if China sets the agenda, and they may.
They've overtaken the U.S. as the world's biggest car market, they've overtaken Germany as the largest exporter, and they've started doing DNA tests on kids to choose their careers.
We're finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know.
Some recent discoveries: There's an ant colony from Argentina that has now spread to every continent but Antarctica; there's a self-directed robot scientist that's made a discovery -- soon, science may no longer need us, and life may no longer need us either; a microbe wakes up after 120,000 years.
It seems that with or without us, life will go on.
But my pick for the top Long News story of this past year was this one: water found on the moon.
Makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there.
And if NASA doesn't do it, China might, or somebody in this room might write a big check.
My point is this: In the long run, some news stories are more important than others.

In the next 18 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey.
And it's a journey that you and I have been on for many years now, and it began some 50 years ago, when humans first stepped off our planet.
And in those 50 years, not only did we literally, physically set foot on the moon, but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets -- all eight of them -- and we have landed on asteroids, we have rendezvoused with comets, and, at this point in time, we have a spacecraft on its way to Pluto, the body formerly known as a planet.
And all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey: a voyage to understand something, to get a sense of our cosmic place, to understand something of our origins, and how Earth, our planet, and we, living on it, came to be.
And of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and search for answers to questions like this, there's Saturn. And we have been to Saturn before -- we visited Saturn in the early 1980s -- but our investigations of Saturn have become far more in-depth in detail since the Cassini spacecraft, traveling across interplanetary space for seven years, glided into orbit around Saturn in the summer of 2004, and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost that humanity had ever established around the Sun.
Now, the Saturn system is a rich planetary system.
It offers mystery, scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare, and the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach.
In fact, just studying the rings alone, we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies.
And here's a beautiful picture of the Andromeda Nebula, which is our closest, largest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way.
And then, here's a beautiful composite of the Whirlpool Galaxy, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.
So the journey back to Saturn is really part of and is also a metaphor for a much larger human voyage to understand the interconnectedness of everything around us, and also how humans fit into that picture.
And it pains me that I can't tell you all that we have learned with Cassini.
I can't show you all the beautiful pictures that we've taken in the last two and a half years, because I simply don't have the time.
So I'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories that have emerged out of this major exploratory expedition that we are conducting around Saturn, and have been for the past two and a half years.
Saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons.
They range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the U.S.
Most of the beautiful pictures we've taken of Saturn, in fact, show Saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons. Here's Saturn with Dione, and then, here's Saturn showing the rings edge-on, showing you just how vertically thin they are, with the moon Enceladus.
Now, two of the 47 moons that Saturn has are standouts.
And those are Titan and Enceladus. Titan is Saturn's largest moon, and, until Cassini had arrived there, was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain that we had remaining in our solar system.
And it is a body that has long intrigued people who've watched the planets.
It has a very large, thick atmosphere, and in fact, its surface environment was believed to be more like the environment we have here on the Earth, or at least had in the past, than any other body in the solar system.
Its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen, like you are breathing here in this room, except that its atmosphere is suffused with simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane.
And these molecules high up in the atmosphere of Titan get broken down, and their products join together to make haze particles.
This haze is ubiquitous. It's completely global and enveloping Titan.
And that's why you cannot see down to the surface with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum.
But these haze particles, it was surmised, before we got there with Cassini, over billions and billions of years, gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface in a thick organic sludge.
So like the equivalent, the Titan equivalent, of tar, or oil, or what -- we didn't know what.
But this is what we suspected. And these molecules, especially methane and ethane, can be liquids at the surface temperatures of Titan.
And so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth.
It's a condensable in the atmosphere, and so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore a whole world of bizarre possibilities. You can have methane clouds, OK, and above those clouds, you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze, which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface.
The temperature at the surface is some 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
But despite that cold, you could have rain falling down on the surface of Titan.
And doing on Titan what rain does on the Earth: it carves gullies; it forms rivers and cataracts; it can create canyons; it can pool in large basins and craters.
It can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills, down into the lowlands. So stop and think for a minute.
Try to imagine what the surface of Titan might look like.
It's dark. High noon on Titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the Earth.
It's cold, it's eerie, it's misty, it might be raining, and you might be standing on the shores of Lake Michigan brimming with paint thinner.
That is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini, and I can tell you that what we have found on Titan, though it is not the same in detail, is every bit as fascinating as that story is.
And for us, it has been like -- the Cassini people -- it has been like a Jules Verne adventure come true.
As I said, it has a thick, extensive atmosphere.
This is a picture of Titan, backlit by the Sun, with the rings as a beautiful backdrop.
And yet another moon there -- I don't even know which one it is. It's a very extensive atmosphere.
We have instruments on Cassini which can see down to the surface through this atmosphere, and my camera system is one of them.
And we have taken pictures like this.
And what you see is bright and dark regions, and that's about as far as it got for us.
It was so mystifying: we couldn't make out what we were seeing on Titan.
When you look closer at this region, you start to see things like sinuous channels -- we didn't know. You see a few round things.
This, we later found out, is, in fact, a crater, but there are very few craters on the surface of Titan, meaning it's a very young surface.
And there are features that look tectonic.
They look like they've been pulled apart.
Whenever you see anything linear on a planet, it means there's been a fracture, like a fault.
And so it's been tectonically altered.
But we couldn't make sense of our images, until, six months after we got into orbit, an event occurred that many have regarded as the highlight of Cassini's investigation of Titan.
And that was the deployment of the Huygens probe, the European-built Huygens probe that Cassini had carried for seven years across the solar system. We deployed it to the atmosphere of Titan, it took two and a half hours to descend, and it landed on the surface.
And I just want to emphasize how significant an event this is.
This is a device of human making, and it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history.
It is so significant that, in my mind, this was an event that should have been celebrated with ticker tape parades in every city across the U.S. and Europe, and sadly, that wasn't the case.
.
It was significant for another reason. This is an international mission, and this event was celebrated in Europe, in Germany, and the celebratory presentations were given in English accents, and American accents, and German accents, and French and Italian and Dutch accents.
It was a moving demonstration of what the words "united nations" are supposed to mean: a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good.
And, in this case, it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet, and to come to understand a planetary system that, for all of human history, had been unreachable, and now humans had actually touched it.
So it was -- I mean, I'm getting goose bumps just talking about it.
It was a tremendously emotional event, and it's something that I will personally never forget, and you shouldn't either.
.
But anyway, the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down, and it also took panoramic pictures.
And I can't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures of Titan's surface from the probe. And this is what we saw.
And it was a shocker, because it was everything we wanted those other pictures taken from orbit to be.
It was an unambiguous pattern, a geological pattern.
It's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids.
And you can follow these channels and you can see how they all converge.
And they converge into this channel here, which drains into this region.
You are looking at a shoreline.
Was this a shoreline of fluids? We didn't know.
But this is somewhat of a shoreline.
This picture is taken at 16 kilometers.
This is the picture taken at eight kilometers, OK? Again, the shoreline.
Okay, now, 16 kilometers, eight kilometers -- this is roughly an airline altitude.
If you were going to take an airplane trip across the U.S., you would be flying at these altitudes.
So, this is the picture you would have at the window of Titanian Airlines as you fly across the surface of Titan.
And then finally, the probe came to rest on the surface, and I'm going to show you, ladies and gentlemen, the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system.
And here is the horizon, OK?
These are probably water ice pebbles, yes?
.
And obviously, it landed in one of these flat, dark regions and it didn't sink out of sight. So it wasn't fluid that we landed in.
What the probe came down in was basically the Titan equivalent of a mud flat.
This is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane.
And it's probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of Titan through these channels that we saw, and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins.
And that is what the Huygens probe landed in.
But still, there was no sign in our images, or even in the Huygens' images, of any large, open bodies of fluids.
Where were they? It got even more puzzling when we found dunes.
OK, so this is our movie of the equatorial region of Titan, showing these dunes. These are dunes that are 100 meters tall, separated by a few kilometers, and they go on for miles and miles and miles.
There's hundreds, up to a 1,000 or 1,200 miles of dunes.
This is the Saharan desert of Titan.
It's obviously a place which is very dry, or you wouldn't get dunes.
So again, it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid, until finally, we saw lakes in the polar regions.
And there is a lake scene in the south polar region of Titan.
It's about the size of Lake Ontario.
And then, only a week and a half ago, we flew over the north pole of Titan and found, again, we found a feature here the size of the Caspian Sea.
So it seems that the liquids, for some reason we don't understand, or during at least this season, are apparently at the poles of Titan.
And I think you would agree that we have found Titan is a remarkable, mystical place. It's exotic, it's alien, but yet strangely Earth-like, and having Earth-like geological formations and a tremendous geographical diversity, and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness is the Earth itself.
And so now we go onto Enceladus. Enceladus is a small moon, it's about a tenth the size of Titan. And you can see it here next to England, just to show you the size. This is not meant to be a threat.
.
And Enceladus is very white, it's very bright, and its surface is obviously wrecked with fractures.
It is a very geologically active body.
But the mother lode of discoveries on Enceladus was found at the south pole -- and we're looking at the south pole here -- where we found this system of fractures.
And they're a different color because they're a different composition.
They are coated. These fractures are coated with organic materials.
Moreover, this whole, entire region, the south polar region, has elevated temperatures. It's the hottest place on the planet, on the body.
That's as bizarre as finding that the Antarctic on the Earth is hotter than the tropics.
And then, when we took additional pictures, we discovered that from these fractures are issuing jets of fine, icy particles extending hundreds of miles into space.
And when we color-code this image, to bring out the faint light levels, we see that these jets feed a plume that, in fact, we see, in other images, goes thousands of miles into the space above Enceladus.
My team and I have examined images like this, and like this one, and have thought about the other results from Cassini.
And we have arrived at the conclusion that these jets may be erupting from pockets of liquid water under the surface of Enceladus.
So we have, possibly, liquid water, organic materials and excess heat.
In other words, we have possibly stumbled upon the holy grail of modern day planetary exploration, or in other words, an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms.
And I don't think I need to tell you that the discovery of life elsewhere in our solar system, whether it be on Enceladus or elsewhere, would have enormous cultural and scientific implications.
Because if we could demonstrate that genesis had occurred not once, but twice, independently, in our solar system, then that means, by inference, it has occurred a staggering number of times throughout the universe and its 13.7 billion year history.
Right now, Earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life.
It is precious, it is unique, it is still, so far, the only home we've ever known.
And if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s -- and we'd forgive you, if you weren't, OK -- you would remember this very famous picture taken by the Apollo 8 astronauts in 1968.
It was the first time that Earth was imaged from space, and it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe, and our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet.
Well, we on Cassini have taken an equivalent first, a picture that no human eye has ever seen before.
It is a total eclipse of the Sun, seen from the other side of Saturn.
And in this impossibly beautiful picture, you see the main rings backlit by the Sun, you see the refracted image of the Sun and you see this ring created, in fact, by the exhalations of Enceladus.
But as if that weren't brilliant enough, we can spot, in this beautiful image, sight of our own planet, cradled in the arms of Saturn's rings.
Now, there is something deeply moving about seeing ourselves from afar, and capturing the sight of our little, blue-ocean planet in the skies of other worlds.
And that, and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that, may be, in the end, the finest reward that we earn from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago.
And thank you very much.

As of 2005, only 15 percent of the world was mapped. This slows the delivery of aid after a disaster -- and hides the economic potential of unused lands and unknown roads. In this short talk, Google's Lalitesh Katragadda demos Map Maker, a group map-making tool that people around the globe are using to map their world.

Lalitesh Katragadda: Making maps to fight disaster, build economies
In 2008, Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar.
Millions of people were in severe need of help.
The U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area.
But there were no maps, no maps of roads, no maps showing hospitals, no way for help to reach the cyclone victims.
When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London, it is hard to believe that as of 2005, only 15 percent of the world was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail.
The U.N. ran headfirst into a problem that the majority of the world's populous faces: not having detailed maps.
But help was coming.
At Google, 40 volunteers used a new software to map 120,000 kilometers of roads, 3,000 hospitals, logistics and relief points.
And it took them four days.
The new software they used? Google Mapmaker.
Google Mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us to map what we know locally.
People have used this software to map everything from roads to rivers, from schools to local businesses, and video stores to the corner store.
Maps matter.
Nobel Prize nominee Hernando De Soto recognized that the key to economic liftoff for most developing countries is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land.
For example, a trillion dollars of real estate remains uncapitalized in India alone.
In the last year alone, thousands of users in 170 countries have mapped millions of pieces of information, and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable.
And this was made possible by the power of passionate users everywhere.
Let's look at some of the maps being created by users right now.
So, as we speak, people are mapping the world in these 170 countries.
You can see Bridget in Africa who just mapped a road in Senegal.
And, closer to home, Chalua, an N.G. road in Bangalore.
This is the result of computational geometry, gesture recognition, and machine learning.
This is a victory of thousands of users, in hundreds of cities, one user, one edit at a time.
This is an invitation to the 70 percent of our unmapped planet.
Welcome to the new world.

In 2003, the Palestinian village of Budrus mounted a 10-month-long nonviolent protest to stop a barrier being built across their olive groves. Did you hear about it? Didn't think so. Brazilian filmmaker Julia Bacha asks why we only pay attention to violence in the Israel-Palestine conflict -- and not to the nonviolent leaders who may one day bring peace.

Julia Bacha: Pay attention to nonviolence
I'm a filmmaker.
For the last 8 years, I have dedicated my life to documenting the work of Israelis and Palestinians who are trying to end the conflict using peaceful means.
When I travel with my work across Europe and the United States, one question always comes up: Where is the Palestinian Gandhi?
Why aren't Palestinians using nonviolent resistance?
The challenge I face when I hear this question is that often I have just returned from the Middle East where I spent my time filming dozens of Palestinians who are using nonviolence to defend their lands and water resources from Israeli soldiers and settlers.
These leaders are trying to forge a massive national nonviolent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region.
Yet, most of you have probably never heard about them.
This divide between what's happening on the ground and perceptions abroad is one of the key reasons why we don't have yet a Palestinian peaceful resistance movement that has been successful.
So I'm here today to talk about the power of attention, the power of your attention, and the emergence and development of nonviolent movements in the West Bank, Gaza and elsewhere -- but today, my case study is going to be Palestine.
I believe that what's mostly missing for nonviolence to grow is not for Palestinians to start adopting nonviolence, but for us to start paying attention to those who already are.
Allow me to illustrate this point by taking you to this village called Budrus.
About seven years ago, they faced extinction, because Israel announced it would build a separation barrier, and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village.
They would lose 40 percent of their land and be surrounded, so they would lose free access to the rest of the West Bank.
Through inspired local leadership, they launched a peaceful resistance campaign to stop that from happening.
Let me show you some brief clips, so you have a sense for what that actually looked like on the ground.
Palestinian Woman: We were told the wall would separate Palestine from Israel.
Here in Budrus, we realized the wall would steal our land.
Israeli Man: The fence has, in fact, created a solution to terror.
Man: Today you're invited to a peaceful march.
You are joined by dozens of your Israeli brothers and sisters.
Israeli Activist: Nothing scares the army more than nonviolent opposition.
Woman: We saw the men trying to push the soldiers, but none of them could do that.
But I think the girls could do it.
Fatah Party Member: We must empty our minds of traditional thinking.
Hamas Party Member: We were in complete harmony, and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine.
Chanting: One united nation.
Fatah, Hamas and the Popular Front!
News Anchor: The clashes over the fence continue.
Reporter: Israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd.
They were allowed to use any force necessary.
Man: These are live bullets.
It's like Fallujah. Shooting everywhere.
Israeli Activist: I was sure we were all going to die.
But there were others around me who weren't even cowering.
Israeli Soldier: A nonviolent protest is not going to stop the [unclear].
Protester: This is a peaceful march.
There is no need to use violence.
Chanting: We can do it! We can do it!
We can do it!
Julia Bacha: When I first heard about the story of Budrus, I was surprised that the international media had failed to cover the extraordinary set of events that happened seven years ago, in 2003.
What was even more surprising was the fact that Budrus was successful.
The residents, after 10 months of peaceful resistance, convinced the Israeli government to move the route of the barrier off their lands and to the green line, which is the internationally recognized boundary between Israel and the Palestinian Territories.
The resistance in Budrus has since spread to villages across the West Bank and to Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem.
Yet the media remains mostly silent on these stories.
This silence carries profound consequences for the likelihood that nonviolence can grow, or even survive, in Palestine.
Violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common; they are both a form of theater seeking an audience to their cause.
If violent actors are the only ones constantly getting front-page covers and attracting international attention to the Palestinian issue, it becomes very hard for nonviolent leaders to make the case to their communities that civil disobedience is a viable option in addressing their plight.
The power of attention is probably going to come as no surprise to the parents in the room.
The surest way to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums is by giving him attention the first time he throws a fit.
The tantrum will become what childhood psychologists call a functional behavior, since the child has learned that he can get parental attention out of it.
Parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior simply by giving or withdrawing attention to their children.
But that's true for adults too.
In fact, the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced, depending on where the international community chooses to focus its attention.
I believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the Middle East and bringing peace is for us to transform nonviolence into a functional behavior by giving a lot more attention to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today.
In the course of taking my film to villages in the West Bank, in Gaza and in East Jerusalem, I have seen the impact that even one documentary film can have in influencing the transformation.
In a village called Wallajeh, which sits very close to Jerusalem, the community was facing a very similar plight to Budrus.
They were going to be surrounded, lose a lot of their lands and not have freedom of access, either to the West Bank or Jerusalem.
They had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention.
So we organized a screening.
A week later, they held the most well-attended and disciplined demonstration to date.
The organizers say that the villagers, upon seeing the story of Budrus documented in a film, felt that there were indeed people following what they were doing, that people cared.
So they kept on going.
On the Israeli side, there is a new peace movement called Solidariot, which means solidarity in Hebrew.
The leaders of this movement have been using Budrus as one of their primary recruiting tools.
They report that Israelis who had never been active before, upon seeing the film, understand the power of nonviolence and start joining their activities.
The examples of Wallajeh and the Solidariot movement show that even a small-budget independent film can play a role in transforming nonviolence into a functional behavior.
Now imagine the power that big media players could have if they started covering the weekly nonviolent demonstrations happening in villages like Bil'in, Ni'lin, Wallajeh, in Jerusalem neighborhoods like Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan -- the nonviolent leaders would become more visible, valued and effective in their work.
I believe that the most important thing is to understand that if we don't pay attention to these efforts, they are invisible, and it's as if they never happened.
But I have seen first hand that if we do, they will multiply.
If they multiply, their influence will grow in the overall Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
And theirs is the kind of influence that can finally unblock the situation.
These leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like Budrus.
Let's give them attention so they can prove it works everywhere.
Thank you.

Simon Sinek has a simple but powerful model for inspirational leadership all starting with a golden circle and the question "Why?" His examples include Apple, Martin Luther King, and the Wright brothers ...

Simon Sinek: How great leaders inspire action
How do you explain when things don't go as we assume?
Or better, how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions?
For example: Why is Apple so innovative?
Year after year, after year, after year, they're more innovative than all their competition.
And yet, they're just a computer company.
They're just like everyone else.
They have the same access to the same talent, the same agencies, the same consultants, the same media.
Then why is it that they seem to have something different?
Why is it that Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement?
He wasn't the only man who suffered in a pre-civil rights America, and he certainly wasn't the only great orator of the day.
Why him?
And why is it that the Wright brothers were able to figure out controlled, powered man flight when there were certainly other teams who were better qualified, better funded ...
and they didn't achieve powered man flight, and the Wright brothers beat them to it.
There's something else at play here.
About three and a half years ago I made a discovery.
And this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the world worked, and it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it.
As it turns out, there's a pattern.
As it turns out, all the great and inspiring leaders and organizations in the world -- whether it's Apple or Martin Luther King or the Wright brothers -- they all think, act and communicate the exact same way.
And it's the complete opposite to everyone else.
All I did was codify it, and it's probably the world's simplest idea.
I call it the golden circle.
Why? How? What?
This little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren't.
Let me define the terms really quickly.
Every single person, every single organization on the planet knows what they do, 100 percent.
Some know how they do it, whether you call it your differentiated value proposition or your proprietary process or your USP.
But very, very few people or organizations know why they do what they do.
And by "why" I don't mean "to make a profit."
That's a result. It's always a result.
By "why," I mean: What's your purpose?
What's your cause? What's your belief?
Why does your organization exist?
Why do you get out of bed in the morning?
And why should anyone care?
Well, as a result, the way we think, the way we act, the way we communicate is from the outside in.
It's obvious. We go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing.
But the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations -- regardless of their size, regardless of their industry -- all think, act and communicate from the inside out.
Let me give you an example.
I use Apple because they're easy to understand and everybody gets it.
If Apple were like everyone else, a marketing message from them might sound like this: "We make great computers.
They're beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly.
Want to buy one?" "Meh."
And that's how most of us communicate.
That's how most marketing is done, that's how most sales is done and that's how most of us communicate interpersonally.
We say what we do, we say how we're different or how we're better and we expect some sort of a behavior, a purchase, a vote, something like that.
Here's our new law firm: We have the best lawyers with the biggest clients, we always perform for our clients who do business with us.
Here's our new car: It gets great gas mileage, it has leather seats, buy our car.
But it's uninspiring.
Here's how Apple actually communicates.
"Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo.
We believe in thinking differently.
The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly.
We just happen to make great computers.
Want to buy one?"
Totally different right? You're ready to buy a computer from me.
All I did was reverse the order of the information.
What it proves to us is that people don't buy what you do; people buy why you do it.
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.
This explains why every single person in this room is perfectly comfortable buying a computer from Apple.
But we're also perfectly comfortable buying an MP3 player from Apple, or a phone from Apple, or a DVR from Apple.
But, as I said before, Apple's just a computer company.
There's nothing that distinguishes them structurally from any of their competitors.
Their competitors are all equally qualified to make all of these products.
In fact, they tried.
A few years ago, Gateway came out with flat screen TVs.
They're eminently qualified to make flat screen TVs.
They've been making flat screen monitors for years.
Nobody bought one.
Dell came out with MP3 players and PDAs, and they make great quality products, and they can make perfectly well-designed products -- and nobody bought one.
In fact, talking about it now, we can't even imagine buying an MP3 player from Dell.
Why would you buy an MP3 player from a computer company?
But we do it every day.
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.
The goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have.
The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe.
Here's the best part: None of what I'm telling you is my opinion.
It's all grounded in the tenets of biology.
Not psychology, biology.
If you look at a cross-section of the human brain, looking from the top down, what you see is the human brain is actually broken into three major components that correlate perfectly with the golden circle.
Our newest brain, our Homo sapien brain, our neocortex, corresponds with the "what" level.
The neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language.
The middle two sections make up our limbic brains, and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings, like trust and loyalty.
It's also responsible for all human behavior, all decision-making, and it has no capacity for language.
In other words, when we communicate from the outside in, yes, people can understand vast amounts of complicated information like features and benefits and facts and figures.
It just doesn't drive behavior.
When we can communicate from the inside out, we're talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior, and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do.
This is where gut decisions come from.
You know, sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures, and they say, "I know what all the facts and details say, but it just doesn't feel right."
Why would we use that verb, it doesn't "feel" right?
Because the part of the brain that controls decision-making doesn't control language.
And the best we can muster up is, "I don't know. It just doesn't feel right."
Or sometimes you say you're leading with your heart, or you're leading with your soul.
Well, I hate to break it to you, those aren't other body parts controlling your behavior.
It's all happening here in your limbic brain, the part of the brain that controls decision-making and not language.
But if you don't know why you do what you do, and people respond to why you do what you do, then how will you ever get people to vote for you, or buy something from you, or, more importantly, be loyal and want to be a part of what it is that you do.
Again, the goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have; the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe.
The goal is not just to hire people who need a job; it's to hire people who believe what you believe.
I always say that, you know, if you hire people just because they can do a job, they'll work for your money, but if you hire people who believe what you believe, they'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears.
And nowhere else is there a better example of this than with the Wright brothers.
Most people don't know about Samuel Pierpont Langley.
And back in the early 20th century, the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day.
Everybody was trying it.
And Samuel Pierpont Langley had, what we assume, to be the recipe for success.
I mean, even now, you ask people, "Why did your product or why did your company fail?"
and people always give you the same permutation of the same three things: under-capitalized, the wrong people, bad market conditions.
It's always the same three things, so let's explore that.
Samuel Pierpont Langley was given 50,000 dollars by the War Department to figure out this flying machine.
Money was no problem.
He held a seat at Harvard and worked at the Smithsonian and was extremely well-connected; he knew all the big minds of the day.
He hired the best minds money could find and the market conditions were fantastic.
The New York Times followed him around everywhere, and everyone was rooting for Langley.
Then how come we've never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley?
A few hundred miles away in Dayton Ohio, Orville and Wilbur Wright, they had none of what we consider to be the recipe for success.
They had no money; they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop; not a single person on the Wright brothers' team had a college education, not even Orville or Wilbur; and The New York Times followed them around nowhere.
The difference was, Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause, by a purpose, by a belief.
They believed that if they could figure out this flying machine, it'll change the course of the world.
Samuel Pierpont Langley was different.
He wanted to be rich, and he wanted to be famous.
He was in pursuit of the result.
He was in pursuit of the riches.
And lo and behold, look what happened.
The people who believed in the Wright brothers' dream worked with them with blood and sweat and tears.
The others just worked for the paycheck.
And they tell stories of how every time the Wright brothers went out, they would have to take five sets of parts, because that's how many times they would crash before they came in for supper.
And, eventually, on December 17th, 1903, the Wright brothers took flight, and no one was there to even experience it.
We found out about it a few days later.
And further proof that Langley was motivated by the wrong thing: The day the Wright brothers took flight, he quit.
He could have said, "That's an amazing discovery, guys, and I will improve upon your technology," but he didn't.
He wasn't first, he didn't get rich, he didn't get famous so he quit.
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.
And if you talk about what you believe, you will attract those who believe what you believe.
But why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe?
Something called the law of diffusion of innovation, and if you don't know the law, you definitely know the terminology.
The first two and a half percent of our population are our innovators.
The next 13 and a half percent of our population are our early adopters.
The next 34 percent are your early majority, your late majority and your laggards.
The only reason these people buy touch tone phones is because you can't buy rotary phones anymore.
We all sit at various places at various times on this scale, but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us is that if you want mass-market success or mass-market acceptance of an idea, you cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point between 15 and 18 percent market penetration, and then the system tips.
And I love asking businesses, "What's your conversion on new business?"
And they love to tell you, "Oh, it's about 10 percent," proudly.
Well, you can trip over 10 percent of the customers.
We all have about 10 percent who just "get it."
That's how we describe them, right?
That's like that gut feeling, "Oh, they just get it."
The problem is: How do you find the ones that get it before you're doing business with them versus the ones who don't get it?
So it's this here, this little gap that you have to close, as Jeffrey Moore calls it, "Crossing the Chasm" -- because, you see, the early majority will not try something until someone else has tried it first.
And these guys, the innovators and the early adopters, they're comfortable making those gut decisions.
They're more comfortable making those intuitive decisions that are driven by what they believe about the world and not just what product is available.
These are the people who stood in line for six hours to buy an iPhone when they first came out, when you could have just walked into the store the next week and bought one off the shelf.
These are the people who spent 40,000 dollars on flat screen TVs when they first came out, even though the technology was substandard.
And, by the way, they didn't do it because the technology was so great; they did it for themselves.
It's because they wanted to be first.
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it and what you do simply proves what you believe.
In fact, people will do the things that prove what they believe.
The reason that person bought the iPhone in the first six hours, stood in line for six hours, was because of what they believed about the world, and how they wanted everybody to see them: They were first.
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.
So let me give you a famous example, a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation.
First, the famous failure.
It's a commercial example.
As we said before, a second ago, the recipe for success is money and the right people and the right market conditions, right? You should have success then.
Look at TiVo.
From the time TiVo came out about eight or nine years ago to this current day, they are the single highest-quality product on the market, hands down, there is no dispute.
They were extremely well-funded.
Market conditions were fantastic.
I mean, we use TiVo as verb.
I TiVo stuff on my piece of junk Time Warner DVR all the time.
But TiVo's a commercial failure.
They've never made money.
And when they went IPO, their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then plummeted, and it's never traded above 10.
In fact, I don't think it's even traded above six, except for a couple of little spikes.
Because you see, when TiVo launched their product they told us all what they had.
They said, "We have a product that pauses live TV, skips commercials, rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits without you even asking."
And the cynical majority said, "We don't believe you.
We don't need it. We don't like it.
You're scaring us."
What if they had said, "If you're the kind of person who likes to have total control over every aspect of your life, boy, do we have a product for you.
It pauses live TV, skips commercials, memorizes your viewing habits, etc., etc."
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it, and what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe.
Now let me give you a successful example of the law of diffusion of innovation.
In the summer of 1963, 250,000 people showed up on the mall in Washington to hear Dr. King speak.
They sent out no invitations, and there was no website to check the date.
How do you do that?
Well, Dr. King wasn't the only man in America who was a great orator.
He wasn't the only man in America who suffered in a pre-civil rights America.
In fact, some of his ideas were bad.
But he had a gift.
He didn't go around telling people what needed to change in America.
He went around and told people what he believed.
"I believe, I believe, I believe," he told people.
And people who believed what he believed took his cause, and they made it their own, and they told people.
And some of those people created structures to get the word out to even more people.
And lo and behold, 250,000 people showed up on the right day at the right time to hear him speak.
How many of them showed up for him?
Zero.
They showed up for themselves.
It's what they believed about America that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours to stand in the sun in Washington in the middle of August.
It's what they believed, and it wasn't about black versus white: 25 percent of the audience was white.
Dr. King believed that there are two types of laws in this world: those that are made by a higher authority and those that are made by man.
And not until all the laws that are made by man are consistent with the laws that are made by the higher authority will we live in a just world.
It just so happened that the Civil Rights Movement was the perfect thing to help him bring his cause to life.
We followed, not for him, but for ourselves.
And, by the way, he gave the "I have a dream" speech, not the "I have a plan" speech.
Listen to politicians now, with their comprehensive 12-point plans.
They're not inspiring anybody.
Because there are leaders and there are those who lead.
Leaders hold a position of power or authority, but those who lead inspire us.
Whether they're individuals or organizations, we follow those who lead, not because we have to, but because we want to.
We follow those who lead, not for them, but for ourselves.
And it's those who start with "why" that have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them.
Thank you very much.

How do you remember where you parked your car? How do you know if you're moving in the right direction? Neuroscientist Neil Burgess studies the neural mechanisms that map the space around us, and how they link to memory and imagination.

Neil Burgess: How your brain tells you where you are
When we park in a big parking lot, how do we remember where we parked our car?
Here's the problem facing Homer.
And we're going to try to understand what's happening in his brain.
So we'll start with the hippocampus, shown in yellow, which is the organ of memory.
If you have damage there, like in Alzheimer's, you can't remember things including where you parked your car.
It's named after Latin for "seahorse," which it resembles.
And like the rest of the brain, it's made of neurons.
So the human brain has about a hundred billion neurons in it.
And the neurons communicate with each other by sending little pulses or spikes of electricity via connections to each other.
The hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells, which are very densely interconnected.
And scientists have begun to understand how spatial memory works by recording from individual neurons in rats or mice while they forage or explore an environment looking for food.
So we're going to imagine we're recording from a single neuron in the hippocampus of this rat here.
And when it fires a little spike of electricity, there's going to be a red dot and a click.
So what we see is that this neuron knows whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment.
And it signals to the rest of the brain by sending a little electrical spike.
So we could show the firing rate of that neuron as a function of the animal's location.
And if we record from lots of different neurons, we'll see that different neurons fire when the animal goes in different parts of its environment, like in this square box shown here.
So together they form a map for the rest of the brain, telling the brain continually, "Where am I now within my environment?"
Place cells are also being recorded in humans.
So epilepsy patients sometimes need the electrical activity in their brain monitoring.
And some of these patients played a video game where they drive around a small town.
And place cells in their hippocampi would fire, become active, start sending electrical impulses whenever they drove through a particular location in that town.
So how does a place cell know where the rat or person is within its environment?
Well these two cells here show us that the boundaries of the environment are particularly important.
So the one on the top likes to fire sort of midway between the walls of the box that their rat's in.
And when you expand the box, the firing location expands.
The one below likes to fire whenever there's a wall close by to the south.
And if you put another wall inside the box, then the cell fires in both place wherever there's a wall to the south as the animal explores around in its box.
So this predicts that sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you -- extended buildings and so on -- is particularly important for the hippocampus.
And indeed, on the inputs to the hippocampus, cells are found which project into the hippocampus, which do respond exactly to detecting boundaries or edges at particular distances and directions from the rat or mouse as it's exploring around.
So the cell on the left, you can see, it fires whenever the animal gets near to a wall or a boundary to the east, whether it's the edge or the wall of a square box or the circular wall of the circular box or even the drop at the edge of a table, which the animals are running around.
And the cell on the right there fires whenever there's a boundary to the south, whether it's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart.
So that's one way in which we think place cells determine where the animal is as it's exploring around.
We can also test where we think objects are, like this goal flag, in simple environments -- or indeed, where your car would be.
So we can have people explore an environment and see the location they have to remember.
And then, if we put them back in the environment, generally they're quite good at putting a marker down where they thought that flag or their car was.
But on some trials, we could change the shape and size of the environment like we did with the place cell.
In that case, we can see how where they think the flag had been changes as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment.
And what you see, for example, if the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment, and then if you ask people where it was, but you've made the environment bigger, where they think the flag had been stretches out in exactly the same way that the place cell firing stretched out.
It's as if you remember where the flag was by storing the pattern of firing across all of your place cells at that location, and then you can get back to that location by moving around so that you best match the current pattern of firing of your place cells with that stored pattern.
That guides you back to the location that you want to remember.
But we also know where we are through movement.
So if we take some outbound path -- perhaps we park and we wander off -- we know because our own movements, which we can integrate over this path roughly what the heading direction is to go back.
And place cells also get this kind of path integration input from a kind of cell called a grid cell.
Now grid cells are found, again, on the inputs to the hippocampus, and they're a bit like place cells.
But now as the rat explores around, each individual cell fires in a whole array of different locations which are laid out across the environment in an amazingly regular triangular grid.
And if you record from several grid cells -- shown here in different colors -- each one has a grid-like firing pattern across the environment, and each cell's grid-like firing pattern is shifted slightly relative to the other cells.
So the red one fires on this grid and the green one on this one and the blue on on this one.
So together, it's as if the rat can put a virtual grid of firing locations across its environment -- a bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you'd find on a map, but using triangles.
And as it moves around, the electrical activity can pass from one of these cells to the next cell to keep track of where it is, so that it can use its own movements to know where it is in its environment.
Do people have grid cells?
Well because all of the grid-like firing patterns have the same axes of symmetry, the same orientations of grid, shown in orange here, it means that the net activity of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain should change according to whether we're running along these six directions or running along one of the six directions in between.
So we can put people in an MRI scanner and have them do a little video game like the one I showed you and look for this signal.
And indeed, you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex, which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats.
So back to Homer.
He's probably remembering where his car was in terms of the distances and directions to extended buildings and boundaries around the location where he parked.
And that would be represented by the firing of boundary-detecting cells.
He's also remembering the path he took out of the car park, which would be represented in the firing of grid cells.
Now both of these kinds of cells can make the place cells fire.
And he can return to the location where he parked by moving so as to find where it is that best matches the firing pattern of the place cells in his brain currently with the stored pattern where he parked his car.
And that guides him back to that location irrespective of visual cues like whether his car's actually there.
Maybe it's been towed.
But he knows where it was, so he knows to go and get it.
So beyond spatial memory, if we look for this grid-like firing pattern throughout the whole brain, we see it in a whole series of locations which are always active when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks, like remembering the last time you went to a wedding, for example.
So it may be that the neural mechanisms for representing the space around us are also used for generating visual imagery so that we can recreate the spatial scene, at least, of the events that have happened to us when we want to imagine them.
So if this was happening, your memories could start by place cells activating each other via these dense interconnections and then reactivating boundary cells to create the spatial structure of the scene around your viewpoint.
And grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space.
Another kind of cell, head direction cells, which I didn't mention yet, they fire like a compass according to which way you're facing.
They could define the viewing direction from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery, so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding, for example.
So this is just one example of a new era really in cognitive neuroscience where we're beginning to understand psychological processes like how you remember or imagine or even think in terms of the actions of the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains.
Thank you very much.

Imagine a global security driven by collaboration -- among agencies, government, the private sector and the public. That's not just the distant hope of open-source fans, it's the vision of James Stavridis, the Supreme Commander of NATO, who shares vivid moments from recent military history to explain why security of the future should be built with bridges rather than walls.

James Stavridis: How NATO's Supreme Commander thinks about global security
I'm gonna talk a little bit about open-source security, because we've got to get better at security in this 21st century.
Let me start by saying, let's look back to the 20th century, and kind of get a sense of how that style of security worked for us.
This is Verdun, a battlefield in France just north of the NATO headquarters in Belgium.
At Verdun, in 1916, over a 300-day period, 700,000 people were killed, so about 2,000 a day.
If you roll it forward -- 20th-century security -- into the Second World War, you see the Battle of Stalingrad, 300 days, 2 million people killed.
We go into the Cold War, and we continue to try and build walls.
We go from the trench warfare of the First World War to the Maginot Line of the Second World War, and then we go into the Cold War, the Iron Curtain, the Berlin Wall.
Walls don't work.
My thesis for us today is, instead of building walls to create security, we need to build bridges.
This is a famous bridge in Europe.
It's in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
It's the bridge over the Drina River, the subject of a novel by Ivo AndriÄ‡, and it talks about how, in that very troubled part of Europe and the Balkans, over time there's been enormous building of walls.
More recently, in the last decade, we begin to see these communities start, hesitatingly, to come together.
I would argue, again, open-source security is about connecting the international, the interagency, the private-public, and lashing it together with strategic communication, largely in social networks.
So let me talk a little bit about why we need to do that, because our global commons is under attack in a variety of ways, and none of the sources of threat to the global commons will be solved by building walls.
Now, I'm a sailor, obviously.
This is a ship, a liner, clipping through the Indian Ocean.
What's wrong with this picture?
It's got concertina wire along the sides of it.
That's to prevent pirates from attacking it.
Piracy is a very active threat today around the world. This is in the Indian Ocean.
Piracy is also very active in the Strait of Malacca.
It's active in the Gulf of Guinea.
We see it in the Caribbean.
It's a $10-billion-a-year discontinuity in the global transport system.
Last year, at this time, there were 20 vessels, 500 mariners held hostage.
This is an attack on the global commons.
We need to think about how to address it.
Let's shift to a different kind of sea, the cyber sea.
Here are photographs of two young men.
At the moment, they're incarcerated.
They conducted a credit card fraud that netted them over 10 billion dollars.
This is part of cybercrime which is a $2-trillion-a-year discontinuity in the global economy.
Two trillion a year.
That's just under the GDP of Great Britain.
So this cyber sea, which we know endlessly is the fundamental piece of radical openness, is very much under threat as well.
Another thing I worry about in the global commons is the threat posed by trafficking, by the movement of narcotics, opium, here coming out of Afghanistan through Europe over to the United States.
We worry about cocaine coming from the Andean Ridge north.
We worry about the movement of illegal weapons and trafficking. Above all, perhaps, we worry about human trafficking, and the awful cost of it.
Trafficking moves largely at sea but in other parts of the global commons.
This is a photograph, and I wish I could tell you that this is a very high-tech piece of US Navy gear that we're using to stop the trafficking.
The bad news is, this is a semi-submersible run by drug cartels.
It was built in the jungles of South America.
We caught it with that low-tech raft â€” â€” and it was carrying six tons of cocaine.
Crew of four. Sophisticated communications sweep.
This kind of trafficking, in narcotics, in humans, in weapons, God forbid, in weapons of mass destruction, is part of the threat to the global commons.
And let's pull it together in Afghanistan today.
This is a field of poppies in Afghanistan.
Eighty to 90 percent of the world's poppy, opium and heroin, comes out of Afghanistan.
We also see there, of course, terrorism.
This is where al Qaeda is staged from.
We also see a very strong insurgency embedded there.
So this terrorism concern is also part of the global commons, and what we must address.
So here we are, 21st century.
We know our 20th-century tools are not going to work.
What should we do?
I would argue that we will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun.
We will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun.
We will need the application of military force.
When we do it, we must do it well, and competently.
But my thesis is, open-source security is about international, interagency, private-public connection pulled together by this idea of strategic communication on the Internet.
Let me give you a couple of examples of how this works in a positive way.
This is Afghanistan. These are Afghan soldiers.
They are all holding books.
You should say, "That's odd. I thought I read that this demographic, young men and women in their 20s and 30s, is largely illiterate in Afghanistan."
You would be correct.
Eighty-five percent cannot read when they enter the security forces of Afghanistan.
Why? Because the Taliban withheld education during the period of time in which these men and women would have learned to read.
So the question is, so, why are they all standing there holding books?
The answer is, we are teaching them to read in literacy courses by NATO in partnership with private sector entities, in partnership with development agencies.
We've taught well over 200,000 Afghan Security Forces to read and write at a basic level.
When you can read and write in Afghanistan, you will typically put a pen in your pocket.
At the ceremonies, when these young men and women graduate, they take that pen with great pride, and put it in their pocket.
This is bringing together international â€” there are 50 nations involved in this mission â€” interagency â€” these development agencies â€” and private-public, to take on this kind of security.
Now, we are also teaching them combat skills, of course, but I would argue, open-source security means connecting in ways that create longer lasting security effect.
Here's another example.
This is a US Navy warship.
It's called the Comfort.
There's a sister ship called the Mercy.
They are hospital ships.
This one, the Comfort, operates throughout the Caribbean and the coast of South America conducting patient treatments.
On a typical cruise, they'll do 400,000 patient treatments.
It is crewed not strictly by military but by a combination of humanitarian organizations: Operation Hope, Project Smile.
Other organizations send volunteers.
Interagency physicians come out.
They're all part of this.
To give you one example of the impact this can have, this little boy, eight years old, walked with his mother two days to come to the eye clinic put on by the Comfort.
When he was fitted, over his extremely myopic eyes, he suddenly looked up and said, "Mama, veo el mundo."
"Mom, I see the world."
Multiply this by 400,000 patient treatments, this private-public collaboration with security forces, and you begin to see the power of creating security in a very different way.
Here you see baseball players.
Can you pick out the two US Army soldiers in this photograph?
They are the two young men on either side of these young boys. This is part of a series of baseball clinics, where we have explored collaboration between Major League Baseball, the Department of State, who sets up the diplomatic piece of this, military baseball players, who are real soldiers with real skills but participate in this mission, and they put on clinics throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, in Honduras, in Nicaragua, in all of the Central American and Caribbean nations where baseball is so popular, and it creates security.
It shows role models to young men and women about fitness and about life that I would argue help create security for us.
Another aspect of this partnership is in disaster relief.
This is a US Air Force helicopter participating after the tsunami in 2004 which killed 250,000 people.
In each of these major disasters â€” the tsunami in 2004, 250,000 dead, the Kashmiri earthquake in Pakistan, 2005, 85,000 dead, the Haitian earthquake, about 300,000 dead, more recently the awful earthquake-tsunami combination which struck Japan and its nuclear industry â€” in all of these instances, we see partnerships between international actors, interagency, private-public working with security forces to respond to this kind of natural disaster.
So these are examples of this idea of open-source security.
We tie it together, increasingly, by doing things like this.
Now, you're looking at this thinking, "Ah, Admiral, these must be sea lanes of communication, or these might be fiber optic cables."
No. This is a graphic of the world according to Twitter.
Purple are tweets. Green are geolocation.
White is the synthesis.
It's a perfect evocation of that great population survey, the six largest nations in the world in descending order: China, India, Facebook, the United States, Twitter and Indonesia.
Why do we want to get in these nets?
Why do we want to be involved?
We talked earlier about the Arab Spring, and the power of all this.
I'll give you another example, and it's how you move this message.
I gave a talk like this in London a while back about this point. I said, as I say to all of you, I'm on Facebook. Friend me.
Got a little laugh from the audience.
There was an article which was run by AP, on the wire.
Got picked up in two places in the world: Finland and Indonesia.
The headline was: NATO Admiral Needs Friends.
Thank you.
Which I do.
And the story was a catalyst, and the next morning I had hundreds of Facebook friend requests from Indonesians and Finns, mostly saying, "Admiral, we heard you need a friend, and oh, by the way, what is NATO?"
So ...
Yeah, we laugh, but this is how we move the message, and moving that message is how we connect international, interagency, private-public, and these social nets to help create security.
Now, let me hit a somber note.
This is a photograph of a brave British soldier.
He's in the Scots Guards.
He's standing the watch in Helmand, in southern Afghanistan.
I put him here to remind us, I would not want anyone to leave the room thinking that we do not need capable, competent militaries who can create real military effect.
That is the core of who we are and what we do, and we do it to protect freedom, freedom of speech, all the things we treasure in our societies.
But, you know, life is not an on-and-off switch.
You don't have to have a military that is either in hard combat or is in the barracks.
I would argue life is a rheostat.
You have to dial it in, and as I think about how we create security in this 21st century, there will be times when we will apply hard power in true war and crisis, but there will be many instances, as we've talked about today, where our militaries can be part of creating 21st-century security, international, interagency, private-public, connected with competent communication.
I would close by saying that we heard earlier today about Wikipedia. I use Wikipedia all the time to look up facts, and as all of you appreciate, Wikipedia is not created by 12 brilliant people locked in a room writing articles.
Wikipedia, every day, is tens of thousands of people inputting information, and every day millions of people withdrawing that information.
It's a perfect image for the fundamental point that no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together.
No one person, no one alliance, no one nation, no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together.
The vision statement of Wikipedia is very simple: a world in which every human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge.
My thesis for you is that by combining international, interagency, private-public, strategic communication, together, in this 21st century, we can create the sum of all security.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
