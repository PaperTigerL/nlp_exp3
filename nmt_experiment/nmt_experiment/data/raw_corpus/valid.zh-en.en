If I duck down, he'll follow me.
He's wary, so he'll keep his eyes on me.
If I come over here, he'll turn to follow me.
If I come over here -- He's smart.
And if I get too close to him, he gets scared just like any other creature.
So in a lot of ways, Romo is like a pet that has a mind of his own.
Thanks, little guy.
Bless you.
And if I want to explore the world -- uh-oh, Romo's tired -- if I want to explore the world with Romo, I can actually connect him from any other iOS device.
So here's the iPad.
And Romo will actually stream video to this device.
So I can see everything that Romo sees, and I get a robot's-eye-view of the world.
Now this is a free app on the App Store, so if any of you guys had this app on your phones, we could literally right now share control of the robot and play games together.
So I'll show you really quickly, Romo actually -- he's streaming video, so you can see me and the entire TED audience.
If I get in front of Romo here.
And if I want to control him, I can just drive.
So I can drive him around, and I can take pictures of you.
I've always wanted a picture of a 1,500-person TED audience.
So I'll snap a picture.
And in the same way that you scroll through content on an iPad, I can actually adjust the angle of the camera on the device.
So there are all of you through Romo's eyes.
And finally, because Romo is an extension of me, I can express myself through his emotions.
So I can go in and I can say let's make Romo excited.
But the most important thing about Romo is that we wanted to create something that was literally completely intuitive.
You do not have to teach someone how to drive Romo.
In fact, who would like to drive a robot?
Okay. Awesome.
Here you go.
Thank you, Scott.
And even cooler, you actually don't have to be in the same geographic location as the robot to control him.
So he actually streams two-way audio and video between any two smart devices.
So you can log in through the browser, and it's kind of like Skype on wheels.
So we were talking before about telepresence, and this is a really cool example.
You can imagine an eight-year-old girl, for example, who has an iPhone, and her mom buys her a robot.
That girl can take her iPhone, put it on the robot, send an email to Grandma, who lives on the other side of the country.
Grandma can log into that robot and play hide-and-go-seek with her granddaughter for fifteen minutes every single night, when otherwise she might only be able to get to see her granddaughter once or twice a year.
Thanks, Scott.
So those are a couple of the really cool things that Romo can do today.
But I just want to finish by talking about something that we're working on in the future.
This is actually something that one of our engineers, Dom, built in a weekend.
It's built on top of a Google open framework called Blockly.
This allows you to drag and drop these blocks of semantic code and create any behavior for this robot you want.
You do not have to know how to code to create a behavior for Romo.
And you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser, which is what you see Romo doing on the left.
And then if you have something you like, you can download it onto your robot and execute it in real life, run the program in real life.
And then if you have something you're proud of, you can share it with every other person who owns a robot in the world.
So all of these wi-fiâ€“enabled robots actually learn from each other.
The reason we're so focused on building robots that everyone can train is that we think the most compelling use cases in personal robotics are personal.
They change from person to person.
So we think that if you're going to have a robot in your home, that robot ought to be a manifestation of your own imagination.
So I wish that I could tell you what the future of personal robotics looks like.
To be honest, I have no idea.
But what we do know is that it isn't 10 years or 10 billion dollars or a large humanoid robot away.
The future of personal robotics is happening today, and it's going to depend on small, agile robots like Romo and the creativity of people like yourselves.
So we can't wait to get you all robots, and we can't wait to see what you build.
Thank you.

Isabel Allende tells tales of passion
Thank you so much. It's really scary to be here among the smartest of the smart.
I'm here to tell you a few tales of passion.
There's a Jewish saying that I love.
What is truer than truth? Answer: The story.
I'm a storyteller. I want to convey something that is truer than truth about our common humanity.
All stories interest me, and some haunt me until I end up writing them.
Certain themes keep coming up: justice, loyalty, violence, death, political and social issues, freedom.
I'm aware of the mystery around us, so I write about coincidences, premonitions, emotions, dreams, the power of nature, magic.
In the last 20 years I have published a few books, but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006, when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy.
That made me a celebrity. Now people recognize me in Macy's, and my grandchildren think that I'm cool.
Allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame.
One of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony, of the opening ceremony, called me and said that I had been selected to be one of the flag-bearers.
I replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity because I'm as far as you can get from being an athlete.
Actually, I wasn't even sure that I could go around the stadium without a walker.
I was told that this was no laughing matter.
This would be the first time that only women would carry the Olympic flag.
Five women, representing five continents, and three Olympic gold medal winners.
My first question was, naturally, what was I going to wear?
A uniform, she said, and asked for my measurements.
My measurements.
I had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak, looking like the Michelin Man.
By the middle of February, I found myself in Turin, where enthusiastic crowds cheered when any of the 80 Olympic teams was in the street.
Those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games.
They all deserved to win, but there's the element of luck.
A speck of snow, an inch of ice, the force of the wind, can determine the result of a race or a game.
However, what matters most -- more than training or luck -- is the heart.
Only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal.
It is all about passion.
The streets of Turin were covered with red posters announcing the slogan of the Olympics.
Passion lives here. Isn't it always true?
Heart is what drives us and determines our fate.
That is what I need for my characters in my books: a passionate heart.
I need mavericks, dissidents, adventurers, outsiders and rebels, who ask questions, bend the rules and take risks.
People like all of you in this room.
Nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters.
They only make good former spouses.
In the green room of the stadium, I met the other flag bearers: three athletes, and the actresses Susan Sarandon and Sophia Loren.
Also, two women with passionate hearts: Wangari Maathai, the Nobel prizewinner from Kenya who has planted 30 million trees. And by doing so, she has changed the soil, the weather, in some places in Africa, and of course the economic conditions in many villages.
And Somaly Mam, a Cambodian activist who fights passionately against child prostitution.
When she was 14 years old, her grandfather sold her to a brothel.
She told us of little girls raped by men who believe that having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from AIDS.
And of brothels where children are forced to receive five, 15 clients per day, and if they rebel, they are tortured with electricity.
In the green room I received my uniform.
It was not the kind of outfit that I normally wear, but it was far from the Michelin Man suit that I had anticipated. Not bad, really.
I looked like a refrigerator.
But so did most of the flag-bearers, except Sophia Loren, the universal symbol of beauty and passion.
Sophia is over 70 and she looks great.
She's sexy, slim and tall, with a deep tan.
Now, how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles?
I don't know.
When asked in a TV interview, "How could she look so good?"
She replied, "Posture. My back is always straight, and I don't make old people's noises."
So, there you have some free advice from one of the most beautiful women on earth.
No grunting, no coughing, no wheezing, no talking to yourselves, no farting.
Well, she didn't say that exactly.
At some point around midnight, we were summoned to the wings of the stadium, and the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag, and the music started -- by the way, the same music that starts here, the Aida March.
Sophia Loren was right in front of me -- she's a foot taller than I am, not counting the poofy hair.
She walked elegantly, like a giraffe on the African savannah, holding the flag on her shoulder. I jogged behind -- on my tiptoes -- holding the flag on my extended arm, so that my head was actually under the damn flag.
All the cameras were, of course, on Sophia.
That was fortunate for me, because in most press photos I appear too, although often between Sophia's legs.
A place where most men would love to be.
The best four minutes of my entire life were those in the Olympic stadium.
My husband is offended when I say this -- although I have explained to him that what we do in private usually takes less than four minutes -- -- so he shouldn't take it personally.
I have all the press clippings of those four magnificent minutes, because I don't want to forget them when old age destroys my brain cells.
I want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics -- passion.
So here's a tale of passion.
The year is 1998, the place is a prison camp for Tutsi refugees in Congo.
By the way, 80 percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world are women and girls.
We can call this place in Congo a death camp, because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation.
The protagonists of this story are a young woman, Rose Mapendo, and her children.
She's pregnant and a widow.
Soldiers have forced her to watch as her husband was tortured and killed.
Somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive, and a few months later, she gives birth to premature twins.
Two tiny little boys.
She cuts the umbilical cord with a stick, and ties it with her own hair.
She names the twins after the camp's commanders to gain their favor, and feeds them with black tea because her milk cannot sustain them.
When the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter, she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go, even when they hold a gun to her head.
Somehow, the family survives for 16 months, and then, by extraordinary luck, and the passionate heart of a young American man, Sasha Chanoff, who manages to put her in a U.S. rescue plane, Rose Mapendo and her nine children end up in Phoenix, Arizona, where they're now living and thriving.
Mapendo, in Swahili, means great love.
The protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women like Rose Mapendo.
I don't make them up. There's no need for that.
I look around and I see them everywhere.
I have worked with women and for women all my life.
I know them well.
I was born in ancient times, at the end of the world, in a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family.
No wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist -- although the term had not reached Chile yet, so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me.
I would soon find out that there was a high price to pay for my freedom, and for questioning the patriarchy.
But I was happy to pay it, because for every blow that I received, I was able to deliver two.
Once, when my daughter Paula was in her twenties, she said to me that feminism was dated, that I should move on.
We had a memorable fight. Feminism is dated?
Yes, for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today, but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage, prostitution, forced labor -- they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed.
They have no control over their bodies or their lives.
They have no education and no freedom.
They are raped, beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity.
For most Western young women of today, being called a feminist is an insult.
Feminism has never been sexy, but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting, and I have seldom suffered from lack of men.
Feminism is not dead, by no means.
It has evolved. If you don't like the term, change it, for Goddess' sake.
Call it Aphrodite, or Venus, or bimbo, or whatever you want; the name doesn't matter, as long as we understand what it is about, and we support it.
So here's another tale of passion, and this is a sad one.
The place is a small women's clinic in a village in Bangladesh.
The year is 2005.
Jenny is a young American dental hygienist who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer during her three-week vacation.
She's prepared to clean teeth, but when she gets there, she finds out that there are no doctors, no dentists, and the clinic is just a hut full of flies.
Outside, there is a line of women who have waited several hours to be treated.
The first patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten molars.
Jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth.
She's not licensed for that; she has never done it.
She risks a lot and she's terrified.
She doesn't even have the proper instruments, but fortunately she has brought some Novocaine.
Jenny has a brave and passionate heart.
She murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation.
At the end, the relieved patient kisses her hands.
That day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth.
The next morning, when she comes again to the so-called clinic, her first patient is waiting for her with her husband.
The woman's face looks like a watermelon.
It is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes.
The husband, furious, threatens to kill the American.
Jenny is horrified at what she has done, but then the translator explains that the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation.
The day before, her husband beat her up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him.
Millions of women live like this today.
They are the poorest of the poor.
Although women do two-thirds of the world's labor, they own less than one percent of the world's assets.
They are paid less than men for the same work if they're paid at all, and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence, and they are constantly threatened by exploitation, violence and abuse.
It is a fact that giving women education, work, the ability to control their own income, inherit and own property, benefits the society.
If a woman is empowered, her children and her family will be better off.
If families prosper, the village prospers, and eventually so does the whole country.
Wangari Maathai goes to a village in Kenya.
She talks with the women and explains that the land is barren because they have cut and sold the trees.
She gets the women to plant new trees and water them, drop by drop.
In a matter of five or six years, they have a forest, the soil is enriched, and the village is saved.
The poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down.
Yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments and also by philanthropy.
For every dollar given to a women's program, 20 dollars are given to men's programs.
Women are 51 percent of humankind.
Empowering them will change everything -- more than technology and design and entertainment.
I can promise you that women working together -- linked, informed and educated -- can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet.
In any war today, most of the casualties are civilians, mainly women and children. They are collateral damage.
Men run the world, and look at the mess we have.
What kind of world do we want?
This is a fundamental question that most of us are asking.
Does it make sense to participate in the existing world order?
We want a world where life is preserved and the quality of life is enriched for everybody, not only for the privileged.
In January I saw an exhibit of Fernando Botero's paintings at the UC Berkeley library.
No museum or gallery in the United States, except for the New York gallery that carries Botero's work, has dared to show the paintings because the theme is the Abu Ghraib prison.
They are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power, in the voluminous Botero style.
I have not been able to get those images out of my mind or my heart.
What I fear most is power with impunity.
I fear abuse of power, and the power to abuse.
In our species, the alpha males define reality, and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality and follow the rules.
The rules change all the time, but they always benefit them, and in this case, the trickle-down effect, which does not work in economics, works perfectly.
Abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom.
Women and children, especially the poor, are at the bottom.
Even the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse -- a woman or a child.
I'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many through gender, income, race, and class.
I think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes in our civilization.
But for real change, we need feminine energy in the management of the world.
We need a critical number of women in positions of power, and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men.
I'm talking about men with young minds, of course.
Old guys are hopeless; we have to wait for them to die off.
Yes, I would love to have Sophia Loren's long legs and legendary breasts.
But given a choice, I would rather have the warrior hearts of Wangari Maathai, Somaly Mam, Jenny and Rose Mapendo.
I want to make this world good.
Not better, but to make it good.
Why not? It is possible. Look around in this room -- all this knowledge, energy, talent and technology.
Let's get off our fannies, roll up our sleeves and get to work, passionately, in creating an almost perfect world.
Thank you.

Every day, in a city the size of London, 30 million meals are served. But where does all the food come from? Architect Carolyn Steel discusses the daily miracle of feeding a city, and shows how ancient food routes shaped the modern world.

Carolyn Steel: How food shapes our cities
How do you feed a city?
It's one of the great questions of our time.
Yet it's one that's rarely asked.
We take it for granted that if we go into a shop or restaurant, or indeed into this theater's foyer in about an hour's time, there is going to be food there waiting for us, having magically come from somewhere.
But when you think that every day for a city the size of London, enough food has to be produced, transported, bought and sold, cooked, eaten, disposed of, and that something similar has to happen every day for every city on earth, it's remarkable that cities get fed at all.
We live in places like this as if they're the most natural things in the world, forgetting that because we're animals and that we need to eat, we're actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient ancestors were.
And as more of us move into cities, more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me -- it's soybean fields in Mato Grosso in Brazil -- in order to feed us.
These are extraordinary landscapes, but few of us ever get to see them.
And increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either.
As more of us move into cities, more of us are eating meat, so that a third of the annual grain crop globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals.
And given that it takes three times as much grain -- actually ten times as much grain -- to feed a human if it's passed through an animal first, that's not a very efficient way of feeding us.
And it's an escalating problem too.
By 2050, it's estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities.
And it's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy consumed.
So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand.
And that's going to pose an enormous problem.
Six billion hungry carnivores to feed, by 2050.
That's a big problem. And actually if we carry on as we are, it's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve.
Nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land.
Although at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to salinization and erosion.
We're very hungry for fossil fuels too.
It takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the West.
And even though there is food that we are producing at great cost, we don't actually value it.
Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away.
And to end all of this, at the end of this long process, we're not even managing to feed the planet properly.
A billion of us are obese, while a further billion starve.
None of it makes very much sense.
And when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations, it's a grim picture.
As we're moving into cities, the world is also embracing a Western diet.
And if we look to the future, it's an unsustainable diet.
So how did we get here?
And more importantly, what are we going to do about it?
Well, to answer the slightly easier question first, about 10,000 years ago, I would say, is the beginning of this process in the ancient Near East, known as the Fertile Crescent.
Because, as you can see, it was crescent shaped.
And it was also fertile.
And it was here, about 10,000 years ago, that two extraordinary inventions, agriculture and urbanism, happened roughly in the same place and at the same time.
This is no accident, because agriculture and cities are bound together. They need each other.
Because it was discovery of grain by our ancient ancestors for the first time that produced a food source that was large enough and stable enough to support permanent settlements.
And if we look at what those settlements were like, we see they were compact.
They were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one at Ur, that were, in fact, effectively, spiritualized, central food distribution centers.
Because it was the temples that organized the harvest, gathered in the grain, offered it to the gods, and then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people.
So, if you like, the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them.
And in fact, that's true of every ancient city.
But of course not all of them were that small.
Famously, Rome had about a million citizens by the first century A.D.
So how did a city like this feed itself?
The answer is what I call "ancient food miles."
Basically, Rome had access to the sea, which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away.
This is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world, because it was very difficult to transport food over roads, which were rough.
And the food obviously went off very quickly.
So Rome effectively waged war on places like Carthage and Egypt just to get its paws on their grain reserves.
And, in fact, you could say that the expansion of the Empire was really sort of one long, drawn out militarized shopping spree, really.
In fact -- I love the fact, I just have to mention this: Rome in fact used to import oysters from London, at one stage. I think that's extraordinary.
So Rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite.
But the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre-industrial world.
If we look at a map of London in the 17th century, we can see that its grain, which is coming in from the Thames, along the bottom of this map.
So the grain markets were to the south of the city.
And the roads leading up from them to Cheapside, which was the main market, were also grain markets.
And if you look at the name of one of those streets, Bread Street, you can tell what was going on there 300 years ago.
And the same of course was true for fish.
Fish was, of course, coming in by river as well. Same thing.
And of course Billingsgate, famously, was London's fish market, operating on-site here until the mid-1980s.
Which is extraordinary, really, when you think about it.
Everybody else was wandering around with mobile phones that looked like bricks and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port.
This is another thing about food in cities: Once its roots into the city are established, they very rarely move.
Meat is a very different story because, of course, animals could walk into the city.
So much of London's meat was coming from the northwest, from Scotland and Wales.
So it was coming in, and arriving at the city at the northwest, which is why Smithfield, London's very famous meat market, was located up there.
Poultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on, to the northeast.
I feel a bit like a weather woman doing this. Anyway, and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes.
And then when they hit the eastern end of Cheapside, that's where they were sold, which is why it's called Poultry.
And, in fact, if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age, you can trace food coming in to it.
You can actually see how it was physically shaped by food, both by reading the names of the streets, which give you a lot of clues.
Friday Street, in a previous life, is where you went to buy your fish on a Friday.
But also you have to imagine it full of food.
Because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold.
And if we look at an image of Smithfield in 1830 you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from.
In fact, if you were having Sunday lunch, the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window about three days earlier.
So this was obviously an organic city, part of an organic cycle.
And then 10 years later everything changed.
This is an image of the Great Western in 1840.
And as you can see, some of the earliest train passengers were pigs and sheep.
So all of a sudden, these animals are no longer walking into market.
They're being slaughtered out of sight and mind, somewhere in the countryside.
And they're coming into the city by rail.
And this changes everything.
To start off with, it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities, really any size and shape, in any place.
Cities used to be constrained by geography; they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means.
All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography.
And as you can see from these maps of London, in the 90 years after the trains came, it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot, and so on, to a large splurge, that would be very, very difficult to feed with anybody on foot, either animals or people.
And of course that was just the beginning. After the trains came cars, and really this marks the end of this process.
It's the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all.
And this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell, devoid of mess, certainly devoid of people, because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape.
In fact, what they did to get food was they got in their cars, drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts, came back with a week's worth of shopping, and wondered what on earth to do with it.
And this really is the moment when our relationship, both with food and cities, changes completely.
Here we have food -- that used to be the center, the social core of the city -- at the periphery.
It used to be a social event, buying and selling food.
Now it's anonymous.
We used to cook; now we just add water, or a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something.
We don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat.
We just read the back of a label on a packet.
And we don't value food. We don't trust it.
So instead of trusting it, we fear it.
And instead of valuing it, we throw it away.
One of the great ironies of modern food systems is that they've made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder.
By making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place, they've actually distanced us from our most important relationship, which is that of us and nature.
And also they've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver, that, as we've seen, are unsustainable.
So what are we going to do about that?
It's not a new question.
500 years ago it's what Thomas More was asking himself.
This is the frontispiece of his book "Utopia."
And it was a series of semi-independent city-states, if that sounds remotely familiar, a day's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad, and grew vegetables in their back gardens, and ate communal meals together, and so on.
And I think you could argue that food is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia, even though More never framed it that way.
And here is another very famous "Utopian" vision, that of Ebenezer Howard, "The Garden City."
Same idea: series of semi-independent city-states, little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around, joined to one another by railway.
And again, food could be said to be the ordering principle of his vision.
It even got built, but nothing to do with this vision that Howard had.
And that is the problem with these Utopian ideas, that they are Utopian.
Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately.
It was a kind of joke, because it's got a double derivation from the Greek.
It can either mean a good place, or no place.
Because it's an ideal. It's an imaginary thing. We can't have it.
And I think, as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling, that makes it not much use.
So I've come up with an alternative, which is Sitopia, from the ancient Greek, "sitos" for food, and "topos" for place.
I believe we already live in Sitopia.
We live in a world shaped by food, and if we realize that, we can use food as a really powerful tool -- a conceptual tool, design tool, to shape the world differently.
So if we were to do that, what might Sitopia look like?
Well I think it looks a bit like this.
I have to use this slide. It's just the look on the face of the dog.
But anyway, this is -- it's food at the center of life, at the center of family life, being celebrated, being enjoyed, people taking time for it.
This is where food should be in our society.
But you can't have scenes like this unless you have people like this.
By the way, these can be men as well.
It's people who think about food, who think ahead, who plan, who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables and actually recognize them.
We need these people. We're part of a network.
Because without these kinds of people we can't have places like this.
Here, I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable.
But networks, markets where food is being grown locally.
It's common. It's fresh.
It's part of the social life of the city.
Because without that, you can't have this kind of place, food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape, and is not just a zero-sum commodity off in some unseen hell-hole.
Cows with a view.
Steaming piles of humus.
This is basically bringing the whole thing together.
And this is a community project I visited recently in Toronto.
It's a greenhouse, where kids get told all about food and growing their own food.
Here is a plant called Kevin, or maybe it's a plant belonging to a kid called Kevin. I don't know.
But anyway, these kinds of projects that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important.
So Sitopia, for me, is really a way of seeing.
It's basically recognizing that Sitopia already exists in little pockets everywhere.
The trick is to join them up, to use food as a way of seeing.
And if we do that, we're going to stop seeing cities as big, metropolitan, unproductive blobs, like this.
We're going to see them more like this, as part of the productive, organic framework of which they are inevitably a part, symbiotically connected.
But of course, that's not a great image either, because we need not to be producing food like this anymore.
We need to be thinking more about permaculture, which is why I think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing.
It's a re-conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives.
The best image I know of this is from 650 years ago.
It's Ambrogio Lorenzetti's "Allegory of Good Government."
It's about the relationship between the city and the countryside.
And I think the message of this is very clear.
If the city looks after the country, the country will look after the city.
And I want us to ask now, what would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today?
What would an allegory of good government look like today?
Because I think it's an urgent question.
It's one we have to ask, and we have to start answering.
We know we are what we eat.
We need to realize that the world is also what we eat.
But if we take that idea, we can use food as a really powerful tool to shape the world better.
Thank you very much.

Karen Armstrong: Let's revive the Golden Rule
For years I've been feeling frustrated, because as a religious historian, I've become acutely aware of the centrality of compassion in all the major world faiths.
Every single one of them has evolved their own version of what's been called the Golden Rule.
Sometimes it comes in a positive version -- "Always treat all others as you'd like to be treated yourself."
And equally important is the negative version -- "Don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you."
Look into your own heart, discover what it is that gives you pain and then refuse, under any circumstance whatsoever, to inflict that pain on anybody else.
And people have emphasized the importance of compassion, not just because it sounds good, but because it works.
People have found that when they have implemented the Golden Rule as Confucius said, "all day and every day," not just a question of doing your good deed for the day and then returning to a life of greed and egotism, but to do it all day and every day, you dethrone yourself from the center of your world, put another there, and you transcend yourself.
And it brings you into the presence of what's been called God, Nirvana, Rama, Tao.
Something that goes beyond what we know in our ego-bound existence.
But you know you'd never know it a lot of the time, that this was so central to the religious life.
Because with a few wonderful exceptions, very often when religious people come together, religious leaders come together, they're arguing about abstruse doctrines or uttering a council of hatred or inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort.
Often people don't really want to be compassionate.
I sometimes see when I'm speaking to a congregation of religious people a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces because people often want to be right instead.
And that of course defeats the object of the exercise.
Now why was I so grateful to TED?
Because they took me very gently from my book-lined study and brought me into the 21st century, enabling me to speak to a much, much wider audience than I could have ever conceived.
Because I feel an urgency about this.
If we don't manage to implement the Golden Rule globally, so that we treat all peoples, wherever and whoever they may be, as though they were as important as ourselves, I doubt that we'll have a viable world to hand on to the next generation.
The task of our time, one of the great tasks of our time, is to build a global society, as I said, where people can live together in peace.
And the religions that should be making a major contribution are instead seen as part of the problem.
And of course it's not just religious people who believe in the Golden Rule.
This is the source of all morality, this imaginative act of empathy, putting yourself in the place of another.
And so we have a choice, it seems to me.
We can either go on bringing out or emphasizing the dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith, or we can go back to the rabbis. Rabbi Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus, who, when asked by a pagan to sum up the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg, said, "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor.
That is the Torah and everything else is only commentary."
And the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that any interpretation of scripture that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate.
And we need to revive that spirit.
And it's not just going to happen because a spirit of love wafts us down.
We have to make this happen, and we can do it with the modern communications that TED has introduced.
Already I've been tremendously heartened at the response of all our partners.
In Singapore, we have a group going to use the Charter to heal divisions recently that have sprung up in Singaporean society, and some members of the parliament want to implement it politically.
In Malaysia, there is going to be an art exhibition in which leading artists are going to be taking people, young people, and showing them that compassion also lies at the root of all art.
Throughout Europe, the Muslim communities are holding events and discussions, are discussing the centrality of compassion in Islam and in all faiths.
But it can't stop there. It can't stop with the launch.
Religious teaching, this is where we've gone so wrong, concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines.
Religious teaching must always lead to action.
And I intend to work on this till my dying day.
And I want to continue with our partners to do two things -- educate and stimulate compassionate thinking.
Education because we've so dropped out of compassion.
People often think it simply means feeling sorry for somebody.
But of course you don't understand compassion if you're just going to think about it.
You also have to do it.
I want them to get the media involved because the media are crucial in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views we have of other people, which are dividing us from one another.
The same applies to educators.
I'd like youth to get a sense of the dynamism, the dynamic and challenge of a compassionate lifestyle.
And also see that it demands acute intelligence, not just a gooey feeling.
I'd like to call upon scholars to explore the compassionate theme in their own and in other people's traditions.
And perhaps above all, to encourage a sensitivity about uncompassionate speaking, so that because people have this Charter, whatever their beliefs or lack of them, they feel empowered to challenge uncompassionate speech, disdainful remarks from their religious leaders, their political leaders, from the captains of industry.
Because we can change the world, we have the ability.
I would never have thought of putting the Charter online.
I was still stuck in the old world of a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room and issuing yet another arcane statement.
And TED introduced me to a whole new way of thinking and presenting ideas.
Because that is what is so wonderful about TED.
In this room, all this expertise, if we joined it all together, we could change the world.
And of course the problems sometimes seem insuperable.
But I'd just like to quote, finish at the end with a reference to a British author, an Oxford author whom I don't quote very often, C.S. Lewis.
But he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind ever since I read it when I was a schoolgirl.
It's in his book "The Four Loves."
He said that he distinguished between erotic love, when two people gaze, spellbound, into each other's eyes.
And then he compared that to friendship, when two people stand side by side, as it were, shoulder to shoulder, with their eyes fixed on a common goal.
We don't have to fall in love with each other, but we can become friends.
And I am convinced.
I felt it very strongly during our little deliberations at Vevey, that when people of all different persuasions come together, working side by side for a common goal, differences melt away.
And we learn amity.
And we learn to live together and to get to know one another.
Thank you very much.

David Macaulay's Rome Antics
I draw to better understand things.
Sometimes I make a lot of drawings and I still don't understand what it is I'm drawing.
Those of you who are comfortable with digital stuff and even smug about that relationship might be amused to know that the guy who is best known for "The Way Things Work," while preparing for part of a panel for called Understanding, spent two days trying to get his laptop to communicate with his new CD burner.
Who knew about extension managers?
I've always managed my own extensions so it never even occurred to me to read the instructions, but I did finally figure it out. I had to figure it out, because along with the invitation came the frightening reminder that there would be no projector, so bringing those carousels would no longer be necessary but some alternate form of communication would.
Now, I could talk about something that I'm known for, something that would be particularly appropriate for many of the more technically minded people here, or I could talk about something I really care about.
I decided to go with the latter.
I'm going to talk about Rome.
Now, why would I care about Rome, particularly?
Well, I went to Rhode Island School of Design in the second half of the '60s to study architecture.
I was lucky enough to spend my last year, my fifth year, in Rome as a student. It changed my life.
Not the least reason was the fact that I had spent those first four years living at home, driving into RISD everyday, driving back.
I missed the '60s. I read about them; I understand they were pretty interesting. I missed them, but I did spend that extraordinary year in Rome, and it's a place that is never far from my mind.
So, whenever given an opportunity, I try to do something in it or with it or for it.
I also make drawings to help people understand things.
Things that I want them to believe I understand.
And that's what I do as an illustrator, that's my job.
So, I'm going to show you some pictures of Rome.
I've made a lot of drawings of Rome over the years.
These are just drawings of Rome. I get back as often as possible -- I need to.
All different materials, all different styles, all different times, drawings from sketchbooks looking at the details of Rome.
Part of the reason I'm showing you these is that it sort of helps illustrate this process I go through of trying to figure out what it is I feel about Rome and why I feel it.
These are sketches of some of the little details.
Rome is a city full of surprises.
I mean, we're talking about unusual perspectives, we're talking about narrow little winding streets that suddenly open into vast, sun-drenched piazzas -- never, though, piazzas that are not humanly scaled.
Part of the reason for that is the fact that they grew up organically.
That amazing juxtaposition of old and new, the bits of light that come down between the buildings that sort of create a map that's traveling above your head of usually blue -- especially in the summer -- compared to the map that you would normally expect to see of conventional streets.
And I began to think about how I could communicate this in book form.
How could I share my sense of Rome, my understanding of Rome?
And I'm going to show you a bunch of dead ends, basically.
The primary reason for all these dead ends is when if you're not quite sure where you're going, you're certainly not going to get there with any kind of efficiency.
Here's a little map. And I thought of maps at the beginning; maybe I should just try and do a little atlas of my favorite streets and connections in Rome.
And here's a line of text that actually evolves from the exhaust of a scooter zipping across the page.
Here that same line of text wraps around a fountain in an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways.
Maybe that line of text could be a story to help give some human aspect to this.
Maybe I should get away from this map completely, and really be honest about wanting to show you my favorite bits and pieces of Rome and simply kick a soccer ball in the air -- which happens in so many of the squares in the city -- and let it bounce off of things. And I'll simply explain what each of those things is that the soccer ball hits.
That seemed like a sort of a cheap shot.
But even though I just started this presentation, this is not the first thing that I tried to do and I was getting sort of desperate.
Eventually, I realized that I had really no content that I could count on, so I decided to move towards packaging.
I mean, it seems to work for a lot of things.
So I thought a little box set of four small books might do the trick.
But one of the ideas that emerged from some of those sketches was the notion of traveling through Rome in different vehicles at different speeds in order to show the different aspects of Rome.
Sort of an overview of Rome and the plan that you might see from a dirigible.
Quick snapshots of things you might see from a speeding motor scooter, and very slow walking through Rome, you might be able to study in more detail some of the wonderful surfaces and whatnot that you come across.
Anyways, I went back to the dirigible notion.
Went to Alberto Santos-Dumont.
Found one of his dirigibles that had enough dimensions so I could actually use it as a scale that I would then juxtapose with some of the things in Rome.
This thing would be flying over or past or be parked in front of, but it would be like having a ruler -- sort of travel through the pages without being a ruler.
Not that you know how long number 11 actually is, but you would be able to compare number 11 against the Pantheon with number 11 against the Baths of Caracalla, and so on and so forth. If you were interested.
This is Beatrix. She has a dog named Ajax, she has purchased a dirigible -- a small dirigible -- she's assembling the structure, Ajax is sniffing for holes in the balloon before they set off.
She launches this thing above the Spanish Steps and sets off for an aerial tour of the city.
Over the Spanish Steps we go.
A nice way to show that river, that stream sort of pouring down the hill.
Unfortunately, just across the road from it or quite close by is the Column of Marcus Aurelius, and the diameter of the dirigible makes an impression, as you can see, as she starts trying to read the story that spirals around the Column of Marcus Aurelius -- gets a little too close, nudges it.
This gives me a chance to suggest to you the structure of the Column of Marcus Aurelius, which is really no more than a pile of quarters high -- thick quarters. Over the Piazza of Saint Ignacio, completely ruining the symmetry, but that aside a spectacular place to visit.
A spectacular framework, inside of which you see, usually, extraordinary blue sky.
Over the Pantheon and the 26-foot diameter Oculus.
She parks her dirigible, lowers the anchor rope and climbs down for a closer look inside.
The text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced to turn the book around, and you can see it from ground point of view and from her point of view -- looking in the hole, getting a different kind of perspective, moving you around the space. Particularly appropriate in a building that can contain perfectly a sphere dimensions of the diameter being the same as the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the Oculus.
Unfortunately for her, the anchor line gets tangled around the feet of some Boy Scouts who are visiting the Pantheon, and they are immediately yanked out and given an extraordinary but terrifying tour of some of the domes of Rome, which would, from their point of view, naturally be hanging upside down.
They bail out as soon as they get to the top of Saint Ivo, that little spiral structure you see there.
She continues on her way over Piazza Navona.
Notices a lot of activity at the Tre Scalini restaurant, is reminded that it is lunchtime and she's hungry.
They keep on motoring towards the Campo de' Fiori, which they soon reach. Ajax the dog is put in a basket and lowered with a list of food into the marketplace, which flourishes there until about one in the afternoon, and then is completely removed and doesn't appear again until six or seven the following morning.
Anyway, the pooch gets back to the dirigible with the stuff.
Unfortunately, when she goes to unwrap the prosciutto, Ajax makes a lunge for it.
She's managed to save the prosciutto, but in the process she loses the tablecloth, which you can see flying away in the upper left-hand corner.
They continue without their tablecloth, looking for a place to land this thing so that they can actually have lunch.
They eventually discover a huge wall that's filled with small holes, ideal for docking a dirigible because you've got a place to tie up.
Turns out to be the exterior wall -- that part of it that remains -- of the Coliseum, so they park themselves there and have a terrific lunch and have a spectacular view.
At the end of lunch, they untie the anchor, they set off through the Baths of Caracalla and over the walls of the city and then an abandoned gatehouse and decide to take one more look at the Pyramid of Cestius, which has this lightning rod on top.
Unfortunately, that's a problem: they get a little too close, and when you're in a dirigible you have to be very careful about spikes.
So that sort of brings her little story to a conclusion.
Marcello, on the other hand, is sort of a lazy guy, but he's not due at work until about noon.
So, the alarm goes off and it's five to 12 or so.
He gets up, leaps onto his scooter, races through the city past the church of Santa Maria della Pace, down the alleys, through the streets that tourists may be wandering through, disturbing the quiet backstreet life of Rome at every turn.
That speed with which he is moving, I hope I have suggested in this little image, which, again, can be turned around and read from both sides because there's text on the bottom and text on the top, one of which is upside down in this image.
So, he keeps on moving, approaching an unsuspecting waiter who is trying to deliver two plates of linguine in a delicate white wine clam sauce to diners who are sitting at a table just outside of a restaurant in the street.
Waiter catches on, but it's too late.
And Marcello keeps moving in his scooter.
Everything he sees from this point on is slightly affected by the linguine, but keeps on moving because this guy's got a job to do.
Removes some scaffolding. One of the reasons Rome remains the extraordinary place it is that because of scaffolding and the determination to maintain the fabric, it is a city that continues to grow and adapt to the needs of the particular time in which it finds itself, or we find it.
Right through the Piazza della Rotonda, in front of the Pantheon -- again wreaking havoc -- and finally getting to work.
Marcello, as it turns out, is the driver of the number 64 bus, and if you've been on the number 64 bus, you know that it's driven with the same kind of exuberance as Marcello demonstrated on his scooter.
And finally Carletto. You see his apartment in the upper left-hand corner.
He's looking at his table; he's planning to propose this evening to his girlfriend of 40 years, and he wants it to be perfect.
He's got candles out, he's got flowers in the middle and he's trying to figure out where to put the plates and the glasses.
But he's not happy; something's wrong.
The phone rings anyway, he's called to the palazzo.
He saunters -- he saunters at a good clip, but as compared to all the traveling we've just seen, he's sauntering.
Everybody knows Carletto, because he's in entertainment, actually; he's in television.
He's actually in television repair, which is why people know him.
So they all have his number.
He arrives at the palazzo, arrives at the big front door.
Enters the courtyard and talks to the custodian, who tells him that there's been a disaster in the palazzo; nobody's TVs are working and there's a big soccer game coming up, and the crowd is getting a little restless and a little nervous.
He goes down to the basement and starts to check the wiring, and then gradually works his way up to the top of the building, apartment by apartment, checking every television, checking every connection, hoping to find out what this problem is.
He works his way up, finally, the grand staircase and then a smaller staircase until he reaches the attic.
He opens the window of the attic, of course, and there's a tablecloth wrapped around the building's television antenna.
He removes it, the problems are solved, everybody in the palazzo is happy.
And of course, he also solves his own problem.
All he has to do now, with a perfect table, is wait for her to arrive.
That was the first attempt, but it didn't seem substantial enough to convey whatever it was I wanted to convey about Rome.
So I thought, well, I'll just do piazzas, and I'll get inside and underneath and I'll show these things growing and show why they're shaped the way they are and so on.
And then I thought, that's too complicated. No, I'll just take my favorite bits and pieces and I'll put them inside the Pantheon but keep the scale, so you can see the top of Sant'Ivo and the Pyramid of Cestius and the Tempietto of Bramante all side by side in this amazing space.
Now that's one drawing, so I thought maybe it's time for Piranesi to meet Escher.
You see that I'm beginning to really lose control here and also hope.
There's a very thin blue line of exhaust that sort of runs through this thing that would be kind of the trail that holds it all together.
Then I thought, "Wait a minute, what am I doing?"
A book is not only a neat way of collecting and storing information, it's a series of layers.
I mean, you always peel one layer off another; we think of them as pages, doing it a certain way.
But think of them as layers. I mean, Rome is a place of layers -- horizontal layers, vertical layers -- and I thought, well just peeling off a page would allow me to -- if I got you thinking about it the right way -- would allow me to sort of show you the depth of layers.
The stucco on the walls of most of the buildings in Rome covers the scars; the scars of centuries of change as these structures have been adapted rather than being torn down.
If I do a foldout page on the left-hand side and let you just unfold it, you see behind it what I mean by scar tissue.
You can see that in 1635, it became essential to make smaller windows because the bad guys were coming or whatever.
Adaptations all get buried under the stucco.
I could peel out a page of this palazzo to show you what's going on inside of it.
But more importantly, I could also show you what it looks like at the corner of one of those magnificent buildings with all the massive stone blocks, or the fake stone blocks done with brick and stucco, which is more often the case.
So it becomes slightly three-dimensional.
I could take you down one of those narrow little streets into one of those surprising piazzas by using a double gate fold -- double foldout page -- which, if you were like me reading a pop-up book as a child, you hopefully stick your head into.
You wrap the pages around your head and are in that piazza for that brief period of time.
And I've really not done anything much more complicated than make foldout pages.
But then I thought, maybe I could be simpler here.
Let's look at the Pantheon and the Piazza della Rotonda in front of it.
Here's a book completely wide open.
OK, if I don't open the book the whole way, if I just open it 90 degrees, we're looking down the front of the Pantheon, and we're looking sort of at the top, more or less down on the square.
And if I turn the book the other way, we're looking across the square at the front of the Pantheon.
No foldouts, no tricks -- just a book that isn't open the whole way.
That seemed promising. I thought, maybe I'll do it inside and I can even combine the foldouts with the only partially opened book.
So we get inside the Pantheon and it grows and so on and so forth.
And I thought, maybe I'm on the right track, but it sort of lost its human quality.
So I went back to the notion of story, which is always a good thing to have if you're trying to get people to pay attention to a book and pick up information along the way.
"Pigeon's Progress" struck me as a catchy title.
If it was a homing pigeon, it would be called "Homer's Odyssey."
But it was the journey of the ...
I mean, if a title works, use it. But it would be a journey that went through Rome and showed all the things that I like about Rome.
It's a pigeon sitting on top of a church.
Goes off during the day and does normal pigeon stuff. Comes back, the whole place is covered with scaffolding and green netting and there's no way this pigeon can get home.
So it's a homeless pigeon now and it's going to have to find another place to live, and that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things, and we start with the tall ones and so on.
Maybe it has to go back and live with family members; that's not always a good thing, but it does sort of bring pigeons together again.
And I thought, that's sort of interesting, but maybe there's a person who should be involved in this in some way.
So I kind of came up with this old guy who spends his life looking after sick pigeons.
He'll go anywhere to get them -- dangerous places and whatnot -- and they become really friends with this guy, and learn to do tricks for him and entertain him at lunchtime and stuff like that.
There's a real bond that develops between this old man and these pigeons.
But unfortunately he gets sick. He gets really sick at the end of the story.
He's taught them to spell his name, which is Aldo.
They show up one day after three or four days of not seeing him -- he lives in this little garret -- and they spell his name and fly around.
And he finally gets enough strength together to climb up the ladder onto the roof, and all the pigeons, a la Red Balloon, are there waiting for him and they carry him off over the walls of the city.
And I forgot to mention this: whenever he lost a pigeon, he would take that pigeon out beyond the walls of the city.
In the old Roman custom, the dead were never buried within the walls.
And I thought that's a really cheery story.
. That's really going to go a long way.
So anyway, I went through ... And again, if packaging doesn't work and if the stories aren't going anywhere, I just come up with titles and hope that a title will sort of kick me off in the right direction.
And sometimes it does focus me enough and I'll even do a title page.
So, these are all title pages that eventually led me to the solution I settled on, which is the story of a young woman who sends a message on a homing pigeon -- she lives outside the walls of the city of Rome -- to someone in the city.
And the pigeon is flying down above the Appian Way here.
You can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth along the way.
If you see the red line, you are seeing the trail of the pigeon; if you don't see the red line, you are the pigeon.
And it becomes necessary and possible, at this point, to try to convey what that sense would be like of flying over the city without actually moving.
Past the Pyramid of Cestius -- these will seem very familiar to you, even if you haven't been to Rome recently -- past the gatehouse.
This is something that's a little bit unusual.
This pigeon does something that most homing pigeons do not do: it takes the scenic route, which was a device that I felt was necessary to actually extend this book beyond about four pages.
So, we circle around the Coliseum, past the Church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin and the Temple of Hercules towards the river.
We almost collide with the cornice of the Palazzo Farnese -- designed by Michelangelo, built of stone taken from the Coliseum -- narrow escape.
We swoop down over the Campo de' Fiori.
This is one of those things I show to my students because it's a complete bastardization -- a denial of any rules of perspective.
The only rule of perspective that I think matters is if it looks believable, you've succeeded.
But you try and figure out where the vanishing points meet here; a couple are on Mars and a couple of others in Cremona.
But into the piazza in front of Santa Maria della Pace, where invariably a soccer game is going on, and we're hit by a soccer ball.
Now this is a terrible illustration of being hit by a soccer ball.
I have all the pieces: there's Santa Maria della Pace, there's a soccer ball, there's a little bit of a bird's wing -- nothing's happening, so I had to rethink it.
And if you do want to see Santa Maria della Pace, these books are really flexible, incredibly interactive -- just turn it around and look at it the other way.
Through the alley, we can see the impact is captured in the red line.
And then bird manages to pull itself together past this medieval tower -- one of the few remaining medieval towers -- towards the church of Sant'Agnese and around the dome looking down into Piazza Navona -- which we've already mentioned and seen and flown over a couple of times; there's the Bernini statue of the Four Rivers -- and then past the wonderful Borromini Sant'Ivo, stopping just long enough on the 26-foot diameter Oculus of the Pantheon to catch our breath.
And then we can swoop inside and around; and because we're flying, we don't really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time, so this drawing can be oriented in any way on the page.
We get a little exuberant as we pass Gesu; it's not surprising to sort of mimic the architecture in this way.
Past the wonderful wall filled with the juxtaposition that I was talking about; beautiful carvings set into the walls above the neon "Ristorante" sign, and so on.
And eventually, we arrive at the courtyard of the palazzo, which is our destination.
Straight up through the courtyard into a little window into the attic, where somebody is working at the drawing board.
He removes the message from the leg of the bird; this is what it says.
As we look at the drawing board, we see what he's working on is, in fact, a map of the journey that the pigeon has just taken, and the red line extends through all the sights.
And if you want the information, so that we complete this cycle of understanding, all you have to do is read these paragraphs.
Thank you very much.
http://www.ted.com/talks/skylar_tibbits_can_we_make_things_that_make_themselves.html
MIT researcher Skylar Tibbits works on self-assembly -- the idea that instead of building something , we can create materials that build themselves, much the way a strand of DNA zips itself together. It's a big concept at early stages; Tibbits shows us three in-the-lab projects that hint at what a self-assembling future might look like.

Skylar Tibbits: Can we make things that make themselves?
Today I'd like to show you the future of the way we make things.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembling, replicating and repairing themselves.
So I'm going to show you what I believe is the current state of manufacturing, and then compare that to some natural systems.
So in the current state of manufacturing, we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years [of assembly time], 500,000 to a million parts, fairly complex, new, exciting technologies in steel, concrete, glass.
We have exciting machines that can take us into space -- five years [of assembly time], 2.5 million parts.
But on the other side, if you look at the natural systems, we have proteins that have two million types, can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds, or DNA with three billion base pairs we can replicate in roughly an hour.
So there's all of this complexity in our natural systems, but they're extremely efficient, far more efficient than anything we can build, far more complex than anything we can build.
They're far more efficient in terms of energy.
They hardly ever make mistakes.
And they can repair themselves for longevity.
So there's something super interesting about natural systems.
And if we can translate that into our built environment, then there's some exciting potential for the way that we build things.
And I think the key to that is self-assembly.
So if we want to utilize self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there's four key factors.
The first is that we need to decode all of the complexity of what we want to build -- so our buildings and machines.
And we need to decode that into simple sequences -- basically the DNA of how our buildings work.
Then we need programmable parts that can take that sequence and use that to fold up, or reconfigure.
We need some energy that's going to allow that to activate, allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program.
And we need some type of error correction redundancy to guarantee that we have successfully built what we want.
So I'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on to achieve this self-assembling future.
The first two are the MacroBot and DeciBot.
So these projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots -- 8 ft., 12 ft. long proteins.
They're embedded with mechanical electrical devices, sensors.
You decode what you want to fold up into, into a sequence of angles -- so negative 120, negative 120, 0, 0, 120, negative 120 -- something like that; so a sequence of angles, or turns, and you send that sequence through the string.
Each unit takes its message -- so negative 120 -- it rotates to that, checks if it got there and then passes it to its neighbor.
So these are the brilliant scientists, engineers, designers that worked on this project.
And I think it really brings to light: Is this really scalable?
I mean, thousands of dollars, lots of man hours made to make this eight-foot robot.
Can we really scale this up? Can we really embed robotics into every part?
The next one questions that and looks at passive nature, or passively trying to have reconfiguration programmability.
But it goes a step further, and it tries to have actual computation.
It basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing, the digital logic gate, directly into your parts.
So this is a NAND gate.
You have one tetrahedron which is the gate that's going to do your computing, and you have two input tetrahedrons.
One of them is the input from the user, as you're building your bricks.
The other one is from the previous brick that was placed.
And then it gives you an output in 3D space.
So what this means is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do.
It computes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do.
And now it starts moving in three-dimensional space -- so up or down.
So on the left-hand side, [1,1] input equals 0 output, which goes down.
On the right-hand side, [0,0] input is a 1 output, which goes up.
And so what that really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build.
So they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed.
So that means that we can have some form of self-replication.
In this case I call it self-guided replication, because your structure contains the exact blueprints.
If you have errors, you can replace a part.
All the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it.
So you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one.
It's directly embedded; there's no external instructions.
So the last project I'll show is called Biased Chains, and it's probably the most exciting example that we have right now of passive self-assembly systems.
So it takes the reconfigurability and programmability and makes it a completely passive system.
So basically you have a chain of elements.
Each element is completely identical, and they're biased.
So each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or left.
So as you assemble the chain, you're basically programming it.
You're telling each unit if it should turn right or left.
So when you shake the chain, it then folds up into any configuration that you've programmed in -- so in this case, a spiral, or in this case, two cubes next to each other.
So you can basically program any three-dimensional shape -- or one-dimensional, two-dimensional -- up into this chain completely passively.
So what does this tell us about the future?
I think that it's telling us that there's new possibilities for self-assembly, replication, repair in our physical structures, our buildings, machines.
There's new programmability in these parts.
And from that you have new possibilities for computing.
We'll have spatial computing.
Imagine if our buildings, our bridges, machines, all of our bricks could actually compute.
That's amazing parallel and distributed computing power, new design possibilities.
So it's exciting potential for this.
So I think these projects I've showed here are just a tiny step towards this future, if we implement these new technologies for a new self-assembling world.
Thank you.

We've been to the moon, we've mapped the continents, we've even been to the deepest point in the ocean -- twice. What's left for the next generation to explore? Biologist and explorer Nathan Wolfe suggests this answer: Almost everything. And we can start, he says, with the world of the unseeably small.

Nathan Wolfe: What's left to explore?
Recently I visited Beloit, Wisconsin.
And I was there to honor a great 20th century explorer, Roy Chapman Andrews.
During his time at the American Museum of Natural History, Andrews led a range of expeditions to uncharted regions, like here in the Gobi Desert.
He was quite a figure.
He was later, it's said, the basis of the Indiana Jones character.
And when I was in Beloit, Wisconsin, I gave a public lecture to a group of middle school students.
And I'm here to tell you, if there's anything more intimidating than talking here at TED, it'll be trying to hold the attention of a group of a thousand 12-year-olds for a 45-minute lecture.
Don't try that one.
At the end of the lecture they asked a number of questions, but there was one that's really stuck with me since then.
There was a young girl who stood up, and she asked the question: "Where should we explore?"
I think there's a sense that many of us have that the great age of exploration on Earth is over, that for the next generation they're going to have to go to outer space or the deepest oceans in order to find something significant to explore.
But is that really the case?
Is there really nowhere significant for us to explore left here on Earth?
It sort of made me think back to one of my favorite explorers in the history of biology.
This is an explorer of the unseen world, Martinus Beijerinck.
So Beijerinck set out to discover the cause of tobacco mosaic disease.
What he did is he took the infected juice from tobacco plants and he would filter it through smaller and smaller filters.
And he reached the point where he felt that there must be something out there that was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known -- bacteria, at the time.
He came up with a name for his mystery agent.
He called it the virus -- Latin for "poison."
And in uncovering viruses, Beijerinck really opened this entirely new world for us.
We now know that viruses make up the majority of the genetic information on our planet, more than the genetic information of all other forms of life combined.
And obviously there's been tremendous practical applications associated with this world -- things like the eradication of smallpox, the advent of a vaccine against cervical cancer, which we now know is mostly caused by human papillomavirus.
And Beijerinck's discovery, this was not something that occurred 500 years ago.
It was a little over 100 years ago that Beijerinck discovered viruses.
So basically we had automobiles, but we were unaware of the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet.
We now have these amazing tools to allow us to explore the unseen world -- things like deep sequencing, which allow us to do much more than just skim the surface and look at individual genomes from a particular species, but to look at entire metagenomes, the communities of teeming microorganisms in, on and around us and to document all of the genetic information in these species.
We can apply these techniques to things from soil to skin and everything in between.
In my organization we now do this on a regular basis to identify the causes of outbreaks that are unclear exactly what causes them.
And just to give you a sense of how this works, imagine that we took a nasal swab from every single one of you.
And this is something we commonly do to look for respiratory viruses like influenza.
The first thing we would see is a tremendous amount of genetic information.
And if we started looking into that genetic information, we'd see a number of usual suspects out there -- of course, a lot of human genetic information, but also bacterial and viral information, mostly from things that are completely harmless within your nose.
But we'd also see something very, very surprising.
As we started to look at this information, we would see that about 20 percent of the genetic information in your nose doesn't match anything that we've ever seen before -- no plant, animal, fungus, virus or bacteria.
Basically we have no clue what this is.
And for the small group of us who actually study this kind of data, a few of us have actually begun to call this information biological dark matter.
We know it's not anything that we've seen before; it's sort of the equivalent of an uncharted continent right within our own genetic information.
And there's a lot of it.
If you think 20 percent of genetic information in your nose is a lot of biological dark matter, if we looked at your gut, up to 40 or 50 percent of that information is biological dark matter.
And even in the relatively sterile blood, around one to two percent of this information is dark matter -- can't be classified, can't be typed or matched with anything we've seen before.
At first we thought that perhaps this was artifact.
These deep sequencing tools are relatively new.
But as they become more and more accurate, we've determined that this information is a form of life, or at least some of it is a form of life.
And while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter are really only in their infancy, there's a very, very exciting possibility that exists: that buried in this life, in this genetic information, are signatures of as of yet unidentified life.
That as we explore these strings of A's, T's, C's and G's, we may uncover a completely new class of life that, like Beijerinck, will fundamentally change the way that we think about the nature of biology.
That perhaps will allow us to identify the cause of a cancer that afflicts us or identify the source of an outbreak that we aren't familiar with or perhaps create a new tool in molecular biology.
I'm pleased to announce that, along with colleagues at Stanford and Caltech and UCSF, we're currently starting an initiative to explore biological dark matter for the existence of new forms of life.
A little over a hundred years ago, people were unaware of viruses, the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet.
A hundred years from now, people may marvel that we were perhaps completely unaware of a new class of life that literally was right under our noses.
It's true, we may have charted all the continents on the planet and we may have discovered all the mammals that are out there, but that doesn't mean that there's nothing left to explore on Earth.
Beijerinck and his kind provide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers -- people like that young girl from Beloit, Wisconsin.
And I think if we phrase that lesson, it's something like this: Don't assume that what we currently think is out there is the full story.
Go after the dark matter in whatever field you choose to explore.
There are unknowns all around us and they're just waiting to be discovered.
Thank you.

Legendary scientist David Deutsch puts theoretical physics on the back burner to discuss a more urgent matter: the survival of our species. The first step toward solving global warming, he says, is to admit that we have a problem.

David Deutsch on our place in the cosmos
We've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising.
So I'll try and do that, but I want to start with two things that everyone already knows.
And the first one, in fact, is something that has been known for most of recorded history.
And that is that the planet Earth, or the solar system, or our environment or whatever, is uniquely suited to sustain our evolution -- or creation, as it used to be thought -- and our present existence, and most important, our future survival.
Nowadays this idea has a dramatic name: Spaceship Earth.
And the idea there is that outside the spaceship, the universe is implacably hostile, and inside is all we have, all we depend on.
And we only get the one chance: if we mess up our spaceship, we've got nowhere else to go.
Now, the second thing that everyone already knows is that contrary to what was believed for most of human history, human beings are not, in fact, the hub of existence.
As Stephen Hawking famously said, we're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet that's in orbit around a typical star, which is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy, and so on.
Now the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of saying that we're at a very un-typical place, uniquely suited and so on, and the second one is saying that we're at a typical place.
And especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by and to inform your life decisions, then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other.
But that doesn't prevent them from both being completely false.
And they are. So let me start with the second one: Typical. Well -- is this a typical place? Well, let's look around, you know, and look in a random direction, and we see a wall, and chemical scum -- -- and that's not typical of the universe at all.
All you've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction and look back, and you won't see any walls or chemical scum at all -- all you see is a blue planet. And if you go further than that, you'll see the sun, the solar system, and the stars and so on.
But that's still not typical of the universe, because stars come in galaxies.
And most places in the universe, a typical place in the universe, is nowhere near any galaxies.
So let's go out further, till we're outside the galaxy, and look back, and yeah, there's the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us.
And at this point we've come 100,000 light years from here.
But we're still nowhere near a typical place in the universe.
To get to a typical place, you've got to go 1,000 times as far as that into intergalactic space.
And so what does that look like? Typical.
What does a typical place in the universe look like?
Well, at enormous expense, TED has arranged a high-resolution immersion virtual reality rendering of intergalactic space -- the view from intergalactic space.
So can we have the lights off, please, so we can see it?
Well, not quite, not quite perfect -- you see, in intergalactic space -- intergalactic space is completely dark, pitch dark.
It's so dark that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you, and that star were to explode as a supernova, and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you, you still wouldn't be able to see even a glimmer.
That's how big and how dark the universe is.
And that's despite the fact that a supernova is so bright, so brilliant an event, that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light years.
And yet from intergalactic space, it's so far away you wouldn't even see it.
It's also very cold out there -- less than three degrees above absolute zero.
And it's very empty. The vacuum there is one million times less dense than the highest vacuum that our best technology on Earth can currently create. So that's how different a typical place is from this place.
And that is how un-typical this place is.
So can we have the lights back on please? Thank you.
Now how do we know about an environment that's so far away, and so different, and so alien, from anything we're used to?
Well, the Earth -- our environment, in the form of us -- is creating knowledge.
Well, what does that mean? Well, look out even further than we've just been -- I mean from here, with a telescope -- and you'll see things that look like stars.
They're called "quasars." Quasars originally meant quasi-stellar object.
Which means things that look a bit like stars. But they're not stars.
And we know what they are. Billions of years ago, and billions of light years away, the material at the center of a galaxy collapsed towards a super-massive black hole.
And then intense magnetic fields directed some of the energy of that gravitational collapse. And some of the matter, back out in the form of tremendous jets which illuminated lobes with the brilliance of -- I think it's a trillion suns.
Now, the physics of the human brain could hardly be more unlike the physics of such a jet.
We couldn't survive for an instant in it. Language breaks down when trying to describe what it would be like in one of those jets.
It would be a bit like experiencing a supernova explosion, but at point-blank range and for millions of years at a time.
And yet, that jet happened in precisely such a way that billions of years later, on the other side of the universe, some bit of chemical scum could accurately describe, and model, and predict, and explain, above all -- there's your reference -- what was happening there, in reality.
The one physical system, the brain, contains an accurate working model of the other -- the quasar.
Not just a superficial image of it, though it contains that as well, but an explanatory model, embodying the same mathematical relationships and the same causal structure.
Now that is knowledge. And if that weren't amazing enough, the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other is increasing with time. That is the growth of knowledge.
So, the laws of physics have this special property.
That physical objects, as unlike each other as they could possibly be, can nevertheless embody the same mathematical and causal structure and to do it more and more so over time.
So we are a chemical scum that is different. This chemical scum has universality.
Its structure contains, with ever-increasing precision, the structure of everything. This place, and not other places in the universe, is a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essence of the whole of the rest of physical reality. And so, far from being insignificant, the fact that the laws of physics allow this, or even mandate that this can happen, is one of the most important things about the physical world.
Now how does the solar system -- and our environment, in the form of us -- acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe?
Well, one thing that's true about Stephen Hawking's remark -- I mean, it is true, but it's the wrong emphasis. One thing that's true about it is that it doesn't do it with any special physics. There's no special dispensation, no miracles involved. It does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance.
One of them is matter, because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing. Information processing is computation, computation requires a computer -- there's no known way of making a computer without matter.
We also need energy to make the computer, and most important, to make the media in effect onto which we record the knowledge that we discover.
And then thirdly, less tangible, but just as essential for the open-ended creation of knowledge, of explanations, is evidence.
Now, our environment is inundated with evidence.
We happen to get round to testing, let's say, Newton's Law of Gravity about 300 years ago.
But the evidence that we used to do that was falling down on every square meter of the Earth for billions of years before that, and will continue to fall on for billions of years afterwards. And the same is true for all the other sciences.
As far as we know, evidence to discover the most fundamental truths of all the sciences is here just for the taking on our planet.
Our location is saturated with evidence, and also with matter and energy.
Out in intergalactic space, those three prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge are at their lowest possible supply.
As I said, it's empty; it's cold; and it's dark out there. Or is it?
Now actually, that's just another parochial misconception.
Because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space, the same size as our home, the solar system. Now that cube is very empty by human standards, but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter.
And a million tons is enough to make, say, a self-contained space station, on which there's a colony of scientists that are devoted to creating an open-ended stream of knowledge, and so on.
Now, it's way beyond present technology to even gather the hydrogen from intergalactic space and form it into other elements and so on.
But the thing is, in a comprehensible universe, if something isn't forbidden by the laws of physics, then what could possibly prevent us from doing it, other than knowing how?
In other words, it's a matter of knowledge, not resources.
And the same -- well, if we could do that we'd automatically have an energy supply, because the transmutation would be a fusion reactor -- and evidence?
Well, again, it's dark out there to human senses. But all you've got to do is take a telescope, even one of present-day design, look out and you'll see the same galaxies as we do from here.
And with a more powerful telescope, you'll be able to see stars, and planets.
In those galaxies, you'll be able to do astrophysics, and learn the laws of physics.
And locally there you could build particle accelerators, and learn elementary particle physics, and chemistry, and so on.
Probably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips -- -- because it would take several hundred million years to get to the nearest life-bearing planet and back.
But I have to tell you -- and sorry, Richard -- but I never did like biology field trips much, and I think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years.
So in fact, intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge. Any such cube, anywhere in the universe, could become the same kind of hub that we are, if the knowledge of how to do so were present there.
So we're not in a uniquely hospitable place.
If intergalactic space is capable of creating an open-ended stream of explanations, then so is almost every other environment. So is the Earth. So is a polluted Earth.
And the limiting factor, there and here, is not resources, because they're plentiful, but knowledge, which is scarce.
Now this cosmic knowledge-based view may -- and I think ought to -- make us feel very special. But it should also make us feel vulnerable, because it means that without the specific knowledge that's needed to survive the ongoing challenges of the universe, we won't survive them.
All it takes is for a supernova to go off a few light years away, and we'll all be dead!
Martin Rees has recently written a book about our vulnerability to all sorts of things, from astrophysics, to scientific experiments gone wrong, and most importantly to terrorism with weapons of mass destruction.
And he thinks that civilization has only a 50 percent chance of surviving this century.
I think he's going to talk about that later in the conference.
Now I don't think that probability is the right category to discuss this issue in.
But I do agree with him about this. We can survive, and we can fail to survive.
But it depends not on chance, but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time.
The danger is not at all unprecedented. Species go extinct all the time.
Civilizations end. The overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations that have ever existed are now history.
And if we want to be the exception to that, then logically our only hope is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species, and our civilization, from all the others -- namely, our special relationship with the laws of physics, our ability to create new explanations, new knowledge -- to be a hub of existence.
So let me now apply this to a current controversy, not because I want to advocate any particular solution, but just to illustrate the kind of thing I mean.
And the controversy is global warming.
Now, I'm a physicist, but I'm not the right kind of physicist. In regard to global warming, I'm just a layman. And the rational thing for a layman to do is to take seriously the prevailing scientific theory. And according to that theory, it's already too late to avoid a disaster.
Because if it's true that our best option at the moment is to prevent CO2 emissions with something like the Kyoto Protocol, with its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars or whatever it is, then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure.
And the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem, merely to postpone it by a little. So it's already too late to avoid it, and it probably has been too late to avoid it ever since before anyone realized the danger.
It was probably already too late in the 1970s, when the best available scientific theory was telling us that industrial emissions were about to precipitate a new ice age in which billions would die.
Now the lesson of that seems clear to me, and I don't know why it isn't informing public debate.
It is that we can't always know. When we know of an impending disaster, and how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself, then there's not going to be much argument, really.
But no precautions, and no precautionary principle, can avoid problems that we do not yet foresee.
Hence, we need a stance of problem-fixing, not just problem-avoidance.
And it's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure, but that's only if we know what to prevent.
If you've been punched on the nose, then the science of medicine does not consist of teaching you how to avoid punches.
If medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only, then it would achieve very little of either.
The world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs.
It ought to be buzzing with plans to reduce the temperature, and with plans to live at the higher temperature -- and not at all costs, but efficiently and cheaply. And some such plans exist, things like swarms of mirrors in space to deflect the sunlight away, and encouraging aquatic organisms to eat more carbon dioxide.
At the moment, these things are fringe research.
They're not central to the human effort to face this problem, or problems in general.
And with problems that we are not aware of yet, the ability to put right -- not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely -- is our only hope, not just of solving problems, but of survival.
So take two stone tablets, and carve on them.
On one of them, carve: "Problems are soluble."
And on the other one carve: "Problems are inevitable."
Thank you.

How can a struggling country break out of poverty if it's trapped in a system of bad rules? Economist Paul Romer unveils a bold idea: "charter cities," city-scale administrative zones governed by a coalition of nations.
business,culture,economics,global issues,politics
608
Paul Romer's radical idea: Charter cities
Take a look at this picture.
It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us.
These African students are doing their homework under streetlights at the airport in the capital city because they don't have any electricity at home.
Now, I haven't met these particular students, but I've met students like them.
Let's just pick one -- for example, the one in the green shirt.
Let's give him a name, too: Nelson.
I'll bet Nelson has a cellphone.
So here is the puzzle.
Why is it that Nelson has access to a cutting-edge technology, like the cellphone, but doesn't have access to a 100-year-old technology for generating electric light in the home?
Now, in a word, the answer is "rules."
Bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that's available when people can bring new technologies in and make them available to someone like Nelson.
What kinds of rules?
The electric company in this nation operates under a rule, which says that it has to sell electricity at a very low, subsidized price -- in fact, a price that is so low it loses money on every unit that it sells.
So it has neither the resources, nor the incentives, to hook up many other users.
The president wanted to change this rule.
He's seen that it's possible to have a different set of rules, rules where businesses earn a small profit, so they have an incentive to sign up more customers.
That's the kind of rules that the cellphone company that Nelson purchases his telephony from operates under.
The president has seen how those rules worked well.
So he tried to change the rules for pricing on electricity, but ran into a firestorm of protest from businesses and consumers who wanted to preserve the existing subsidized rates.
So he was stuck with rules that prevented him from letting the win-win solution help his country.
And Nelson is stuck studying under the streetlights.
The real challenge then, is to try to figure out how we can change rules.
Are there some rules we can develop for changing rules?
I want to argue that there is a general abstract insight that we can make practical, which is that, if we can give more choices to people, and more choices to leaders -- who, in many countries, are also people.
But, it's useful to present the opposition between these two.
Because the kind of choice you might want to give to a leader, a choice like giving the president the choice to raise prices on electricity, takes away a choice that people in the economy want.
They want the choice to be able to continue consuming subsidized electric power.
So if you give just to one side or the other, you'll have tension or friction.
But if we can find ways to give more choices to both, that will give us a set of rules for changing rules that get us out of traps.
Now, Nelson also has access to the Internet.
And he says that if you want to see the damaging effects of rules, the ways that rules can keep people in the dark, look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night.
In particular check out Asia.
If you zoom in here, you can see North Korea, in outline here, which is like a black hole compared to its neighbors.
Now, you won't be surprised to learn that the rules in North Korea keep people there in the dark.
But it is important to recognize that North Korea and South Korea started out with identical sets of rules in both the sense of laws and regulations, but also in the deeper senses of understandings, norms, culture, values and beliefs.
When they separated, they made choices that led to very divergent paths for their sets of rules.
So we can change -- we as humans can change the rules that we use to interact with each other, for better, or for worse.
Now let's look at another region, the Caribbean.
Zoom in on Haiti, in outline here.
Haiti is also dark, compared to its neighbor here, the Dominican Republic, which has about the same number of residents.
Both of these countries are dark compared to Puerto Rico, which has half as many residents as either Haiti or the Dominican Republic.
What Haiti warns us is that rules can be bad because governments are weak.
It's not just that the rules are bad because the government is too strong and oppressive, as in North Korea.
So that if we want to create environments with good rules, we can't just tear down.
We've got to find ways to build up, as well.
Now, China dramatically demonstrates both the potential and the challenges of working with rules.
Back in the beginning of the data presented in this chart, China was the world's high-technology leader.
Chinese had pioneered technologies like steel, printing, gunpowder.
But the Chinese never adopted, at least in that period, effective rules for encouraging the spread of those ideas -- a profit motive that could have encouraged the spread.
And they soon adopted rules which slowed down innovation and cut China off from the rest of the world.
So as other countries in the world innovated, in the sense both of developing newer technologies, but also developing newer rules, the Chinese were cut off from those advances.
Income there stayed stagnant, as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world.
This next chart looks at more recent data.
It plots income, average income in China as a percentage of average income in the United States.
In the '50s and '60s you can see that it was hovering at about three percent.
But then in the late '70s something changed.
Growth took off in China. The Chinese started catching up very quickly with the United States.
If you go back to the map at night, you can get a clue to the process that lead to the dramatic change in rules in China.
The brightest spot in China, which you can see on the edge of the outline here, is Hong Kong.
Hong Kong was a small bit of China that, for most of the 20th century, operated under a very different set of rules than the rest of mainland China -- rules that were copied from working market economies of the time, and administered by the British.
In the 1950s, Hong Kong was a place where millions of people could go, from the mainland, to start in jobs like sewing shirts, making toys.
But, to get on a process of increasing income, increasing skills led to very rapid growth there.
Hong Kong was also the model which leaders like Deng Xiaoping could copy, when they decided to move all of the mainland towards the market model.
But Deng Xiaoping instinctively understood the importance of offering choices to his people.
So instead of forcing everyone in China to shift immediately to the market model, they proceeded by creating some special zones that could do, in a sense, what Britain did: make the opportunity to go work with the market rules available to the people who wanted to opt in there.
So they created four special economic zones around Hong Kong: zones where Chinese could come and work, and cities grew up very rapidly there; also zones where foreign firms could come in and make things.
One of the zones next to Hong Kong has a city called Shenzhen.
In that city there is a Taiwanese firm that made the iPhone that many of you have, and they made it with labor from Chinese who moved there to Shenzhen.
So after the four special zones, there were 14 coastal cites that were open in the same sense, and eventually demonstrated successes in these places that people could opt in to, that they flocked to because of the advantages they offered.
Demonstrated successes there led to a consensus for a move toward the market model for the entire economy.
Now the Chinese example shows us several points.
One is: preserve choices for people.
Two: operate on the right scale.
If you try to change the rules in a village, you could do that, but a village would be too small to get the kinds of benefits you can get if you have millions of people all working under good rules.
On the other hand, the nation is too big.
If you try to change the rules in the nation, you can't give some people a chance to hold back, see how things turn out, and let others zoom ahead and try the new rules.
But cities give you this opportunity to create new places, with new rules that people can opt in to.
And they're large enough to get all of the benefits that we can have when millions of us work together under good rules.
So the proposal is that we conceive of something called a charter city.
We start with a charter that specifies all the rules required to attract the people who we'll need to build the city.
We'll need to attract the investors who will build out the infrastructure -- the power system, the roads, the port, the airport, the buildings.
You'll need to attract firms, who will come hire the people who move there first.
